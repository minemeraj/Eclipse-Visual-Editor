<strong>Project Name:</strong> VE<br>
<br>
<strong>Project Leaders:</strong> David Orme<br>

<br>
<strong>Project Description:</strong> The Eclipse Visual Editor project is a framework 
for creating GUI builders for Eclipse. It will include reference implementations 
of Swing/JFC and SWT GUI builders, but intends to be useful for creating GUI builders 
for other languages such as C/C++ and alternate widget sets, including those that 
are not supported under Java. See 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/vep">http://www.eclipse.org/vep</a><br>
<br>
<strong>Executive Summary:</strong>With VEP 1.0, we have delivered a platform 
that is functional on Linux/GTK and is very usable on Windows.  Further, we have 
implemented all of the minimum features required to support both the Swing and 
SWT widget toolkits, in standalone and in Eclipse Rich Client Platform 
applications.<br>
<br>
The main areas that we are focusing on in our upcoming release include performance--both 
general and cross-platform, and API documentation.<br>
