<p>[<b>Eclipse project plan template 1.0 - last revised Sept. 30, 2004</b></p>



<p><b>This is the plan template for Eclipse projects. It's basic format follows
that of the ones for the Eclipse Platform top-level project.
Fill-ins are enclosed in double braces, which has the advantage for being easy
to spot in both raw and rendered HTML. Comments, like this one, are in bold and
enclosed in square brackets (obviously they'll all need to be deleted). The aim
is to have all Eclipse plans be "mostly" uniform, but provide freedom
to deviate where it makes sense. The key characteristic is that the plans
"feel" the same; the details may vary. The plan template can be
expected to evolve over time based on feedback from the various projects.)</b></p>



<p><b>Eclipse
projects are somewhat hierarchical: (1) top-level projects, (2)
projects within a top-level project, and (3) subsystems within a level
2
project. Plans are likely to be somewhat hierarchical as well. For
simplicity,
this template is written in the form of a plan for a top-level
project with
multiple projects within it. Subsystems are not explicitly mentioned.
However,
most projects under the umbrella Eclipse Tools top-level project will
provide
their own independent plans. To this end, this template uses the
fill-in
{{primary project name}}, which can be substituted with either the name
of&nbsp;
top-level project or the name of a project depending on the
circumstance.</b></p>


<p><b>Note: Plans are nominally authored by the top-level project's PMC. "We..." means
"We, the top-level project's PMC, ..."</b></p>


<p><b>Project names should be capitalized (e.g., "Web Tools Platform"); use all-caps
for acronyms (e.g., "GEF").</b></p>


<p><b>Reminder: Edit the page author &lt;meta name="Author"
content="Eclipse {{top-level project name}} PMC"&gt;</b></p>


<p><b>Reminder:
Edit the&nbsp;page title &lt;title&gt;Eclipse {{primary
project name}} - DRAFT {{version}} Plan&lt;/title&gt;<br>

<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release
of the Eclipse {{primary project name}} project after {{previous version}}, designated release
{{version}}.
</p>

<ul>


  <li><a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">Target operating environments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility with previous releases</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, plans are posted in an embryonic form and then revised from time to
time throughout the release cycle.
</p>

<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The
remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the projects under
the Eclipse {{primary project name}} project. Each plan item covers a
feature or API that is to be added, or some aspect that is to be
improved. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a
concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a
suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work
item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.
</p>

<p>[<b>Creating a special bugzilla
report for each plan item allows any member of the Eclipse community to register
their interest in, and comment on, individual plan items. Recommended format for
plan item bug reports:<br>
Summary: [Plan Item] {{Item title}}<br>
Description: {{Item description}}<br>
Keyword: plan<br>
Version: {{previous version}}<br>
Target Milestone: {{version}}<br>
Priority: P4<br>
Severity: enhancement</b>]
</p>

<p>Not
all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is
localized
to a single subsystem; others may involve coordinated changes across
several
projects within the same top-level project; and others may involve
coordination with other top-level projects. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing that others, the plan items
appear in
no particular order.
</p>

<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature work.
</p>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>


<p>The release deliverables are:
</p>

<ul>


  <li>Source code release for Eclipse {{primary project name}}, available as versions tagged
    "{{release version tag - e.g., R1_1}}" in the eclipse.org <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS
    repository</a>.</li>
  <li>{{primary project}} runtime binary and SDK distributions (downloadable).</li>
  <li>{{primary project}} runtime binary and SDK features on eclipse.org update site
    (install via Eclipse update manager).</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>


<p>[<b>A regular schedule of release milestone throughout the release
cycle helps keep things on track and gives the community a very visible metric
of progress. The Eclipse Platform top-level project finds that a release cycle
of about a year with milestones every 6 weeks is working fairly well for their
teams. Your mileage may vary.</b>]</p>


<p>Release milestone occurring at roughly {{N}} week intervals exist to facilitate
coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones are:</p>


<ul>


  <li>{{milestone date}} - Milestone 1 ({{version}} M1) - {{characteristics}}</li>
  <li>{{milestone date}} - Milestone 2 ({{version}} M2) - {{characteristics}}</li>
  <li>{{...}}</li>
</ul>


<p>The {{version}} release is targeted for {{anticipated release date - usually
just the quarter until late in project)}}. All release deliverables will be
available for download as soon as the release has been tested and validated in
the target operating configurations listed below.</p>


<h2><a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>


<p>In order to remain current, each release of an Eclipse project targets reasonably current
versions of underlying operating environments and other Eclipse projects on
which it depends.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Most of Eclipse is "pure" Java™ code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is on the
Eclipse Platform, and on the Java 2 Platform that runs it.</p>


<p>The {{primary project name}} {{version} release depends on the following:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Java 2 Platform {{JDK version; e.g., 1.4}}</li>
  <li>Eclipse Platform {{platform version; e.g., 3.0}}</li>
  <li>{{versions of other Eclipse projects; e.g., EMF 2.0}}</li>
</ul>


<p> The {{version}} release of {{primary project name}} is designed to run on any configuration supporting the above components.</p>


<p>The Eclipse Platform runs in a variety of operating environments. Testing is
focused on a handful of popular
<span class="header">combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these
are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many
operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we
do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered
when running Eclipse on non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any
reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running
Eclipse on a reference platform.</span></p>


<p> {{primary project name}} {{version}} is tested and validated on the following reference platforms:</p>


<table border="1">


  <tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc">
    <th colspan="4">
      <div align="center">
        <b><font size="+1">Eclipse Reference Platforms</font></b>

  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>[<b>See the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_1.html">Eclipse
Project 3.1 plan</a> for a list of reference platforms.</b>]</p>


<h4>Internationalization</h4>


<p> Eclipse is designed as the basis for internationalized products.
The user interface elements provided by the various Eclipse projects, including
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings for {{primary project name}}
are provided
as the default resource bundles. Translations are not provided with this
release. However, the plug-in fragment mechanism provides the means by which translations into any number of
other languages can be incorporated.</p>


<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>


<p>[<b>Compatible evolution is the basis for long-lived software, and the norm
for all Eclipse projects. The following boilerplate spells this out. In
exception circumstances, a project may need to deviate from the norm. If that is
the case, it is critical that this section explains how and why this project
differs from the norm of compatibility.</b>]</p>


<h3>Compatibility of Release {{version}} with {{previous version}}</h3>


<p>Eclipse {{primary project name}} {{version}} will be compatible with {{primary project name}}
{{previous version}}.</p>


<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> {{primary project name}} {{version}} will be upwards
contract-compatible with {{primary project name}} {{previous version}} except in those areas noted
in the <i>{{primary project name}}</i><i> {{version}} Migration</i><em> Guide</em>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points
will need to be ported to {{primary project name}} {{version}} APIs. Downward contract compatibility
is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with {{primary project name}}
{{version}} APIs would ensure compliance with {{primary project name}} {{previous version}} APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain contract compatibility.</p>


<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> {{primary project name}} {{version}} will be upwards
binary-compatible with {{primary project name}} {{previous version}} except in those areas noted in the
<i>{{primary project name}}</i><i> {{version}} Migration</i><em> Guide</em>. Downward plug-in compatibility is not
supported: plug-ins compiled against {{primary project name}} {{version}} will
likely be unusable with {{primary project name}} {{previous version}}. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain binary compatibility.
</p>

<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b>   Source files written to use {{primary project name}}
{{previous version}} APIs will usually compile and
run successfully against {{primary project name}} {{version}} APIs,
although this cannot be guaranteed. In some cases, it may be necessary to make
minor changes to the source code to disambiguate things like imports or
overloaded method invocations. Downward source compatibility is not supported.
If source files use new APIs, they will not be usable with earlier versions.
</p>

<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b>
Eclipse {{primary project name}} {{version}} will be upwards
workspace-compatible with {{primary project name}} {{previous version}}
unless noted. This means that
workspaces and projects created by an Eclipse with {{primary project
name}} {{previous
version}} installed can be successfully opened
by an Eclipse with {{primary project name}} {{version}} installed. This
includes both hidden
metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as
metadata
files found within a workspace project, which may
propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories.
User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is
upgraded.
Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. Metadata files
created (or overwritten)
by the newer version will generally be unusable with older versions.
</p>

<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins.
</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>


<p>[<b>Themes are used to draw attention to the main thrusts of the release, and
help to in organizing the plan items. See the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_1.html">Eclipse
Project 3.1 plan</a> for examples of theme and plan item write-ups.</b>]</p>


<p> The changes under consideration for the next release of Eclipse {{primary project name}}
address a few major themes:</p>


<ul>


  <li><b>{{Theme1 title} </b>- {{Theme1 description}}</li>
  <li><b>{{Theme2 title} </b>- {{Theme2 description}}</li>
</ul>


<p>Each theme has a number of items; the relevant theme is identified for each committed, proposed, and deferred
plan items.</p>


[<b>For top-level projects with only a single project, or where the plan is for
a primary project that is not a top-level project, delete the next paragraph and
the corresponding section heads, and just substitute the primary project name
for {{project1 name}}.</b>]
<p>
Each of the projects under the Eclipse {{primary project name}} project is covered in its
own section:</p>


<ul>


  <li><a href="#project1">{{project1 name}}</a><a href="#project1"> project</a></li>
  <li>{{others}}</li>
</ul>


<p>For each project, the items listed reflect new features or
areas where existing features will be significantly reworked. Numbers in parentheses link to
bugzilla problem reports for that plan item.
</p>

<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
</p>

<ul>


  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="project1">{{project1 name} project</a></h2>


<p>{{A sentence that locates project1 in the grand scheme
of things.}} Plan
items reflect new features of the {{project1 name}} project, or areas where existing
features will be significantly reworked.</p>


<h4>Committed Items ({{project1 name}} project)</h4>


<blockquote>
  <p><b>{{Item1 title}}.</b> {{Item1 description}} ({{link to plan item1 bugzilla
  report}}) [Theme: {{theme title}}]</p>
