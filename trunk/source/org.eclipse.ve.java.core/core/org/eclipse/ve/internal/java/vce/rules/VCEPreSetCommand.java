 * This is the default vce preSet command returned by the VCE Property Rule.

 * 
 * The following constraints on the target and value are invalid:
 * 
 *   1) Target is a JCMMethod and feature is not <members>. We don't know how to handle such situation.
 *   2) Target is immediately contained by a JCMMethod, but it is not the <members> or <properties> relationship. We
 *      don't know how to handle such situations (varient on (1)).
 *   3) Target is not immediately contained by a <properties> or <members> but somewhere above target the containment
 *      is by <properties>. This is invalid because if there were any settings on the top level <property>
 *      there should of been a preset call done on it and it would of been made a <member> instead.
 *   4) Target is not immediately contained by a JCMMethod but somewhere above target containment is
 *      a JCMMethod, but the containment is not <members>. This is invalid. This is a varient on (2) and (3).
 *   5) <properties> on BeanSubclassComposition are invalid.
