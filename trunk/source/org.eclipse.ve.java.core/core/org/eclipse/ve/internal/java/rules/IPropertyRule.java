	 * PreSet of a property. Called before setting of a property. This
	 * allows the new property to be scoped properly, plus anything else
	 * needed to add a property to the domain.
     * It will walk through all children and preSet them too.
     * 
     * This should only be called if this is a new setting. It should not
     * be called for "touch" because no need to change scoping.
     * 
     * Since it will walk through children it is best to call this at the
     * highest point in the tree of properties as possible. If you are setting
     * a property which contains other properties, don't call preSet on any
     * of the children properties because that would be duplicate effort and
     * not needed.
     * 
     * Note: This will also handle adding the annotations in case any of
     * the child settings have annotations.
     * 
	 * @param  domain The domain of the application so that the rule can handle
	 *                 proper scoping of the new property.
	 * @param  target The target of the property. Used to determine scoping. It must
	 *                 already be scoped by the time the command is executed. It does not
	 *                 need to be scoped when requesting the command thru the rule. Therefore
	 *                 any rule override MUST return a command that will not do any checking of scoping
	 *                 until actual execution. It cannot do scoping checks during prepare/canExecute.
	 *                 If not scoped by time of execution it may or may not permit scoping. That
	 *                 is rule implementation specific, a specific implementation may be able to handle this.
	 * @param  newValue The new value that needs to be scoped.
	 * @param  feature The feature that is being set with the new value. Used to help determine scoping, e.g.
	 *                  if the feature is a containment, then the new value itself will not be scoped, though
	 *                  children will be. There are times the feature isn't known (e.g. when dealing with IPropertySources
	 *                  IPropertyDescriptors) then pass in null. This will be treated as non-containment. This would
	 *                  cause a slight problem because it may cause an extra scoping to occur, which will correct itself
	 *                  in the end.
	 * 
	 * @return a command that will perform the preset.

	 * something from the domain. It will walk through all of the
	 * children and PostSet them to.
	 * 
	 * This should be called only if the property had been set and was not a touch.
	 * If the property wasn't set, or it was a touch, then the old value is still valid.
	 * 
     * Since it will walk through children it is best to call this at the
     * highest point in the tree of properties as possible. If you are unsetting
     * a property which contains other properties, don't call postSet on any
     * of the children properties because that would be duplicate effort and
