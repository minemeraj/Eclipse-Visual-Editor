gridbagconstraints.gridx      = grid x
gridbagconstraints.gridx.Desc = Specifies the cell containing the leading edge of the component's display area.
gridbagconstraints.gridy      = grid y
gridbagconstraints.gridy.Desc = Specifies the cell at the top of the component's display area.
gridbagconstraints.gridwidth  = grid width
gridbagconstraints.gridwidth.Desc = Specifies the number of cells in a row for the component's display area.
gridbagconstraints.gridheight = grid height
gridbagconstraints.gridheight.Desc = Specifies the number of cells in a column for the component's display area.
gridbagconstraints.weightx    = weight x
gridbagconstraints.weightx.Desc = Specifies how to distribute extra horizontal space.
gridbagconstraints.weighty    = weight y
gridbagconstraints.weighty.Desc = Specifies how to distribute extra vertical space.
gridbagconstraints.anchor     = anchor
gridbagconstraints.anchor.Desc = This field is used when the component is smaller than its display area.
gridbagconstraints.fill       = fill
gridbagconstraints.fill.Desc  = This field is used when the component's display area is larger than the component's requested size.
gridbagconstraints.ipadx      = x internal padding
gridbagconstraints.ipadx.Desc = This field specifies the internal padding, how much space to add to the minimum width of the component.
gridbagconstraints.ipady      = y internal padding
gridbagconstraints.ipady.Desc = This field specifies the internal padding, how much space to add to the minimum height of the component.
gridbagconstraints.insets     = insets
gridbagconstraints.insets.Desc = This field specifies the external padding, the minimum amount of space between the component and the edges of its display area.
