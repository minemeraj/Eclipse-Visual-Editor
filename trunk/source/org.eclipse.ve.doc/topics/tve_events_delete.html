<h1 class="topictitle1">Deleting events from a component</h1>
<div><p>You can use the Java Beans view to delete an event that you added
to a component.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip: </span>If you do not see any events in the Java Beans view,
make sure that you click the Java Beans view menu arrow and select <span class="uicontrol">Show
Events</span> to show events or <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> to
show events, adapters, and listeners.</div>
<p>To delete an event from a componentselect
it in the Java Beans tree view and use the Delete pop-up menu option or the
keyboard delete key.  </p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Right-click the event in the Java Beans view.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span> from the pop-up menu.</span> <ul><li>In <span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span> mode this will remove from the Java
source the callback method for the event.  If the listener class implements
an interface that requires a method body for compilation, then the method
contents are cleared out rather than the method being removed entirely.<br /><img src="../images/DeleteWindowClosed_01.gif" alt="delete window closed" /><br /><p>If
having deleted the callback method there are no remaining method body implementations
on the listener and the listener is an anonymous inner class, then the listener
itself is removed together with the method that registers it with the source. In
the above example, the Window listener only has a windowOpened callback, so
when windowOpened is deleted then the listener and the <samp class="codeph">addWindowListener(...)</samp> 
statement that adds it to the source will be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>In <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> mode, when a callback method is
deleted it is removed from the listener, or replaced with an empty method
body if the listener implements the interface and must have a method to successfully
compile. Unlike "Show Events" however, no cascaded delete of the listener
is done, so even if the listener has no remaining callback method bodies left
is it not automatically removed.<br /><img src="../images/DeleteExpertMode_01.gif" alt="delete expert mode" /><br /><p>Delete in <span class="uicontrol">Expert
Events</span> mode can be thought of as deleting the selected tree item
from its parent.</p>
<p>The listener itself can also be selected and deleted. This
will remove the listener from the Java Bean. If the listener is an anonymous
inner class it will be removed from the source. However, for a name listener
class it will still remain after it has been removed from Java beans that
use it.<br /><img src="../images/DeleteExpertMode_02.gif" alt="delete expert mode" /><br /></p>
