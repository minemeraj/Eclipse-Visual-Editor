<h1 class="topictitle1">Code generation</h1><div><p>The Visual Editor for Java is a source centric editor that reads and writes
the .java source file. This round tripping between the Visual Editor and the
source is done incrementally so that as you make a change to a Java bean the
source is changed, and likewise as you change the source the Java bean is
changed.</p>
<p>When the Visual Editor for Java is closed the only file that is persisted
in Eclipse is the .java file. There is no additional file that stores
metadata so that changes can be made to the file in another editor, such as
the Java Editor from VisualAge, and these will be reflected in the Visual
Editor when it is next opened. When the Visual Editor for Java is opened to
determine the initial state of the Java beans the file is parsed and analyzed
for certain patterns. These are used to create a model of the Java beans and
their initial property settings and any relationships between them. You can
make modifications to the source and see these reflected in the Java beans'
model as long as the source still adheres to the recognized patterns.</p>
<div class="p"><p class="sectiontitle">Incremental round tripping of source code changes</p><p>As
you change the contents of the .java source file with the Java Visual Editor
open, it performs incremental analysis of the changes to determine how the
change affects the Java beans. These changes can be made in the source editor
embedded within the Visual Editor, or within another editor open on the same
file within Eclipse. When a change has occurred, it then synchronizes
these changes with the model of the Java beans displayed in the Design view,
the Java Beans view and the Properties view. If the change is limited to the
contents of a single method's arguments, then the single property is updated
in the model of the Java bean. </p>
<p>If the change is outside a method or
within multiple methods, then the contents of the entire file are reparsed.
This reparsing is done using background threads. So, you should not see any
decrease in the performance of typing code into the Java source view. If a
situation occurs where the model of the Java beans is out of step with the
source code for any reason, then you can click the reload button, located
in the bottom right corner of the status line.</p>
