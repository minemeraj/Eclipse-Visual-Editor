<h1 class="topictitle1">BeanInfo classes and introspection</h1>
<div><p>If you are creating new components or beans for use within the
visual editor (for example, adding components to the palette), you can control
their behavior by supplying a BeanInfo class.</p>
<p>A BeanInfo class implements <samp class="codeph">java.beans.BeanInfo</samp> and is
used by the visual editor to determine the behavior of the properties view
for the bean, and whether a customizer is available. The visual editor includes
BeanInfo classes for common AWT and Swing controls.</p>
<p>Since the BeanInfo class contains information required only at design time,
it is usually kept in a different project from the bean class itself and not
included when the bean is deployed. The visual editor for Java uses a number
of rules that allow you to associate BeanInfo classes with the Java beans
they describe. You need to understand these rules if you are using Java beans
having BeanInfo classes that you want the visual editor to detect. For instance,
if you are using a third party set of Java bean classes, or if you have developed
Java beans and BeanInfo classes that you are using.</p>
<p>To learn more about BeanInfo classes you can download the JavaBeans specification
from  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs" target="_blank">java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs/</a>.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Background</h4><p>The class <tt class="sysout">java.beans.Introspector</tt> 
is used to locate a BeanInfo class for a Java bean. The time that this occurs
is referred to as <i>introspection</i>, and is done by the visual editor the
first time a bean is used. For example, when a button is first dropped from
the palette, introspection occurs that tries to locate the correct BeanInfo
class. After introspecting the bean, the results are cached to help performance.
However, when the visual editor detects that the BeanInfo class may have changed
and the cache is stale, introspection will re-occur.  </p>
<p>Introspection
of a bean is done by calling the  <tt class="sysout">getBeanInfo(Class)</tt> static
method with the bean class as the argument. For example:</p>
<p> <tt class="sysout">java.beans.Introspector.getBeanInfo(MyJavaBean.class)</tt> </p>
<p>The introspector uses the following logic to locate a BeanInfo class
for the argument class  <tt class="sysout">MyJavaBean</tt>. This involves
a number of sequential steps, and after any successful step the introspector
stops looking. If any step fails, then the next step is used to try a different
way to locate the bean info.</p>
<ul><li>If the Java bean itself implements  <tt class="sysout">java.beans.BeanInfo</tt>,
then it is used. This scenario rarely occurs, however, because it means that
the run-time class  <tt class="sysout">MyJavaBean</tt> contains design
time information that will be unnecessarily included at deployment.</li>
<li>A class with the same name as the argument, but the string  <tt class="sysout">BeanInfo</tt> appended
to it is searched for. For example,  <tt class="sysout">MyJavaBeanBeanInfo.</tt> It
is first searched for in the same package as the class, and if one is not
found, it is located within a defined search path. Rather than use the class
path of the Java virtual machine to search for the BeanInfo class, the introspector
has its own list of packages to search within. This is known as the BeanInfo
search path. The introspector does not use the class path again in order to
keep run-time and design time information separate.</li>
<li>If no BeanInfo class is found for the immediate class being introspected,
then the introspector attempts to locate the BeanInfo class for the superclass.</li>
<li>If no BeanInfo class is found for the immediate class being introspected,
then a default one is created. The default will take the results of the introspection
of the immediate superclass and merge in the results of the default properties
of the immediate class. The rules for creating the default properties are
to match  <tt class="sysout">get</tt> and  <tt class="sysout">set</tt> methods
with compatible names and arguments. For example, the method  <tt class="sysout">public
void setName(String aName)</tt> and  <tt class="sysout">public String
getName()</tt> are paired into a property called  <tt class="sysout">name</tt>.
The BeanInfo created is not stored as a class in any package. It is a transient
instance that is used as a temporary description of the bean's design time
details, so that the visual editor can extract a list of properties and other
information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a BeanInfo class is found for the class, then the introspector
does not return it explicitly. Instead, it uses its details to create a temporary
result class that implements <tt class="sysout">java.beans.BeanInfo</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle">BeanInfo search path</h4><p>The best way to understand
the BeanInfo path is to consider the Java virtual machine that is created
to perform introspection. This virtual machine is given a class path that
is made up of following entries:  </p>
<ul><li>The items in the Java build path for the project itself</li>
<li>The items in the BeanInfo classes on the BeanInfo path for the project
itself</li>
<li>All exported items in the BeanInfo classes for any projects in the Java
build path</li>
</ul>
<p>Having created the virtual machine, the <tt class="sysout">java.beans.Introspector</tt> 
has its list of packages to search for BeanInfo classes set with the method <tt class="sysout">public
void setSearchPath(String[])</tt>.</p>
<p>The arguments to this method
are:  </p>
<ul><li>The items in the packages list on the BeanInfo path for the project itself</li>
<li>All exported items in the packages lists for any projects in the Java
build path</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle">BeanInfo and inherent attributes</h4><p>If the bean you
are writing is inheriting attributes from a super class, the default BeanInfo
will not expose the inherent attributes. You have to explicitly expose them
with the getAdditionalBeanInfo() method.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>public BeanInfo[] getAdditionalBeanInfo() { 
try {                 
         // The following will return all inherited features.                 
         return new BeanInfo[] { 
Introspector.getBeanInfo(MyPanel.class.getSuperclass())};  
} catch (IntrospectionException e) {            
return new BeanInfo[0];            
} </pre>
<p>If an inherent attribute is not exposed, the visual editor
 will not render it, even if it is set in the source code.  </p>
