<h1 class="topictitle1">Viewing events for a component</h1>
<div><p>The Java Beans view shows all of the events set on the components
in your visual class.</p>
<div class="section"><p>The Java Beans view has three modes for showing events:</p>
<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">No Events</span></li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span></li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To view the events on a component:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>On the Java Beans view toolbar, click the menu (arrow) button.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select <span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Expert
Events</span>.</span> <ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span><p>When <span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span> is
selected, the events used by each component are shown as children in the tree.
Events are marked with green arrows <img src="../images/icons/e2mconn_obj.gif" alt="green arrows" />, property change events are marked with blue arrows <img src="../images/icons/p2pconn_obj.gif" alt="blue arrow icon" />.</p>
<p>For an event to be
used by a component, there must be a registered listener, and the callback
method must have some code within it. The list of recognized source code patterns
used by the visual editor are described in the source code patterns for events
section. In the following image, the Java Beans view shows a JFrame with a
windowOpened event, and it shows a button with an actionPerformed event. The
button also has a PropertyChangeListener for its enabled properties, and this
is shown with a blue arrow instead of green. </p>
<p><img src="../images/BasicEventsChildren.gif" alt="Basic Events" /></p>
<p>Each
event is made up of the source component (the JFrame or JButton in the example
being used), a class that implements the listener interface that is added
to the source using addXXXListener(XXXListener), and some code within the
body of the callback method. </p>
</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span><p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> mode,
each listener for the component is shown as a child tree node, and the events
are shown beneath each listener. This increases the number of items in the
tree, but it shows more detail about how the events are attached to the components.
The option of the two modes lets you decide which level of detail you want
to work with.</p>
<p>In expert mode the icon used for the listener shows the
type of listener class. If the listener is an anonymous inner class that implements
the listener interface, the <img src="../images/icons/anoninter_obj.gif" alt="event present icon" /> icon is used, and if the listener is an anonymous inner class
that extends a listener adapter class, the <img src="../images/icons/anonclass_obj.gif" alt="event present class" /> icon is used.</p>
<p>In
addition to anonymous inner classes being used for listeners, named classes
and shared listeners are also parsed and recognized by the visual editor.
If the listener is not anonymous in expert mode, then the icon is <img src="../images/icons/genlistener_obj.gif" alt="gen listener icon" /> . If the listener is shared
by more than one component, the <img src="../images/icons/shrdclass_obj.gif" alt="shared class object" /> is used. If the listener class is used by a single event, then
these are listed as children of the listener. However, if the listener class
is used by more than one event listener interface for the component, in Expert
mode these listener interfaces are shown as separate children of the listener
class, as shown in the following image:<br /><img src="../images/ExpertEvents_Shared.gif" alt="expert events shared" /><br /> </p>
<p>The source for this is shown in the following
code statement. The inner listener class IvjEventHandler is used once by the
first button (this) for a keyPressedEvent, and twice by the "Cancel" button,
once for keyPressed (that is part of the key event) and another time for actionPerformed
(that is part of the action event).</p>
<div class="p"> <pre>class IvjEventHandler implements java.awt.event.ActionListener, java.awt.event.KeyListener {    public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent e) {      
   if (e.getSource() == VCEStyle2.this.getCancelButton())     
   connEtoC3(e);   
};    
 public void keyPressed(java.awt.event.KeyEvent e) {      
    if (e.getSource() == VCEStyle2.this.getCancelButton())     
    connEtoC2(e);   
if (e.getSource() == VCEStyle2.this)     
    connEtoC1(e);   
};    
 public void keyReleased(java.awt.event.KeyEvent e) {};    
 public void keyTyped(java.awt.event.KeyEvent e) {}; 
}; </pre>
