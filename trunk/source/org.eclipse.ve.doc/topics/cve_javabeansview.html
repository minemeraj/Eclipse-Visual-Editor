<h1 class="topictitle1">The Java Beans view</h1>
<div><p>The Java Beans view of the visual editor for Java shows a tree
view of the components, events, and listeners used by the Java class that
you are composing. You can use this view to work with the components.</p>
<p>By default, the Java Beans view is automatically opened each time the visual
editor for Java is launched, unless you have changed your preferences.<br /><img src="../images/javabeansview.gif" alt="Java Beans view" /><br /> </p>
<div class="p">The following are key features of the Java Beans view:<ul><li>You can use the Java Beans view to directly work with the beans. By right-clicking
on a component in the Java Beans view, you can perform various actions such
as cut, copy and paste, delete, and update text.</li>
<li>You can drag components to reorder and nest them.</li>
<li>The selection between the Java Beans view and the Design view is synchronized
both ways. If you select items in the Design view, they are also selected
in the Java Beans view. </li>
<li>In the Java Beans view, the icon shown for the entry is the same icon
used in the palette to represent the component type.</li>
<li>The label for each component in the Java Beans view is the name of the
instance variable that is used in the Java code for the component. For some
types of components, the label also contains details from the instance itself,
for example the text of a button or label.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>A special part called <samp class="codeph">this</samp> is shown on the Java Beans
view to represent the instance of the class itself that is being composed.
You cannot delete the <samp class="codeph">this</samp> element.</div>
