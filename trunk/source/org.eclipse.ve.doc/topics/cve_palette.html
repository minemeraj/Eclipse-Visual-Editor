<h1 class="topictitle1">The visual editor palette</h1>
<div><p>The visual editor for Java includes a palette of components and
other selection tools for you to use in the Design view.</p>
<p>By default, the design palette is collapsed on the right side of the Design
view in the visual editor for Java. You can resize the palette, collapse it,
and choose whether you want the palette collapsed by default. For more information,
see <a href="tve_prefsappearance.html#tve_prefsappearance">Customizing the appearance of the visual editor for Java</a>.</p>
<div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip: </span>You can access the same Java components found on the palette
by clicking the arrow next to the Choose bean <img src="../images/choosebean_toolbar.gif" alt="Choose Bean toolbar button" /> toolbar
button.</div>
<div class="p">The design palette includes the following selection tools:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Selection</span> - The Selection tool is the default cursor
tool used for selecting existing components in the Design view. You can select
multiple components in both the Java Beans view and the Design view by holding
down the Ctrl key.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Marquee</span> - The Marquee tool is a selection tool
that you use to drag a rectangular selection area. All components that lie
completely within the selection rectangle are selected.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Choose bean</span> - The Choose bean tool opens the <span class="uicontrol">Choose
a bean</span> selection dialog where you can search for the component
that you want to drop onto the Design view. The component that you select
becomes the active element for the cursor.</li>
</ul>
<br /><img src="../images/palette.gif" /><br /></div>
<p>The design palette also includes common components, containers, menus,
and controls for SWT, Swing, and AWT. The components are organized by type
using drawers that you can expand, collapse, and pin open.</p>
<p>When you select a tool or a component from the design palette, it becomes
the active behavior for your cursor. For example, if you select a SWT Button
on the palette and then move your cursor over the Design view, the visual
editor will give visual cues about the availability and location of placement.
When you click in a valid position, the Button will be dropped onto the design.
After you drop the component, your cursor reverts to the default selection
cursor.</p>
<p>The SWT controls and containers are only included in the palette for projects
that include the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) library on the Java build path.
This library is automatically added to your project when you create a new
SWT visual class. You can also manually add the library on the Java Build
Path page of the project properties. Remember that SWT controls and containers
can only be used with SWT applications.</p>
