<h1 class="topictitle1">The visual editor Design and Source views</h1>
<div><p>The visual editor for Java is divided into two main windows: the
Design view and the Source view. The Design view previews the Java beans in
a graphical representation, while the Source view shows the associated Java
code.</p>
<p>Visual beans that are SWT, Swing, or AWT components, or subclasses of these
components, are shown in the Design view with their graphical representation.
As you modify the Java beans in the Design view, the source is updated. Conversely,
as you change the Java source, the Design view updates to reflect the changes
you make. Also, if you make changes to your .java source file in another editor,
your changes will be reflected in the Design window of the visual editor.</p>
<p>The visual editor for Java, by default, shows the Design view above the
Source view on a split pane. The Design view is a WYSIWYG surface, or canvas,
where you can compose the GUI that you are building. The Source view shows
the contents of the Java file. The collapsible palette is on the right side
of the Design view by default. The palette includes selection tools and components
that you can add to the design.</p>
<p><img src="../images/designsourceviews.gif" alt="Design and Source views" /> </p>
<p>You can change the default so that the Design and Source views are notebook
tabs, allowing you to click back and forth between them. To change the default,
click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Java</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Visual Editor</span></span>.
Select the <span class="uicontrol">Appearance</span> tab, then click <span class="uicontrol">On
Separate notebook tabs</span>. Close the visual editor for Java, then
open it again to refresh your preference change.</p>
