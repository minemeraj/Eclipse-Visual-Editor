<h1 class="topictitle1">Keeping beans and BeanInfo classes in the same package</h1>
<div><p>A Java bean and its associated BeanInfo class are
in the same package, then the introspector will be able to find the BeanInfo
class.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><p>This is the simplest but also least likely scenario because coupling
the run-time and design time classes in the same package makes for more work
at deployment time to separate them.</p>
<p>For example, a project called <b>MyProject</b> contains
a package called <b>myclasses</b> that contains the classes <b>MyJavaBean</b> and <b>MyJavaBeanBeanInfo</b>.
Whenever the bean <b>myclasses.MyJavaBean</b> is used, either for development
of a class within <b>MyProject</b> or for development of a class in another
project that includes <b>MyProject</b> in its Java build path, the introspector
will locate its BeanInfo class <b>myclasses.MyJavaBeanBeanInfo</b>.</p>
<p>To
keep BeanInfo classes in the same package as your visual classes:</p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>In the Java perspective, create your BeanInfo classes.</span></li>
<li><span>Save the BeanInfo classes in the same project and same package
as your beans that use the BeanInfo classes.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace">The visual editor will locate and introspect the BeanInfo classes
during design time to determine the properties of the Java bean.</div>
</div>
