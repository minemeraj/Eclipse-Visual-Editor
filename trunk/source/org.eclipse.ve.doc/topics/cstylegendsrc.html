<h1 class="topictitle1">Style of generated source</h1>
<div><p>The style of code generated for Java beans is currently based on the style
used by the Visual Composition Editor within VisualAge for Java. A default
constructor is created that calls the method  <samp class="codeph">initialize()</samp>,
which sets the values of the properties for the class. For applets, the code
to set the initial property values is called  <samp class="codeph">init()</samp>.</p>
<p>This is not called by the constructor as it will be executed by the applet
browser itself. For any other Java beans that are included in the class, a
field is created that is prefixed with <samp class="codeph">ivj</samp>. <samp class="codeph">Ivj</samp> is
only needed in classes not subclassing java.awt.Component. Most visual beans
have no special prefix. The  <samp class="codeph">ivj</samp> and the <samp class="codeph">get</samp>method
lazily initialize the field using its null constructor and sets its properties.
Lazy initialization of a field means that the field is only created and initialized
if it is null, rather than being initialized within the constructor. </p>
<p>When the Visual Composition Editor generates the  <samp class="codeph">get</samp> method,
it puts the code within a  <samp class="codeph">try{}catch{}</samp> block that the Visual
Editor for Java is able to parse and recognize. However, if it continuously
catches every exception thrown during initialization, then the risk of exceptions
being suppressed increases. Therefore, it is better to let the exception pass
through instead. However, if you wish to have a  <samp class="codeph">try{}catch{}</samp> block
generated, open the Preferences for the Visual Editor for Java and change
the value of the check box  <b>Generate try{}catch{} block</b> shown below.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/CustomizationPreferences1.gif" alt="Visual Editor preferences" /> </p>
<p>To distinguish which methods have been generated by the Visual Editor for
Java, select the option  <b>Generate a comment for new expressions</b> from
the preferences dialog shown above. When the option is 'true', a comment  <samp class="codeph">//Generated</samp> will
be appended to any new statements generated by the Visual Editor for Java.</p>
<p>The following example code is for a newly generated JButton with both options,
 <b>Generate a comment for new expressions</b> and  <b>Generate try{}catch{}
block</b>, set to 'true'. The statement for the  <samp class="codeph">setText("OK"</samp>)
method that was generated from the Properties view has the comment  <samp class="codeph">//Generated</samp> appended.</p>
<pre>private javax.swing.JButton getJButton1() {
    if (ivjJButton1 == null) {
       ivjJButton1 = new javax.swing.JButton();
       ivjJButton1.setText("OK");  // Generated
    } catch (Throwable ivjExc) {
    }
    return ivjJButton1;
}</pre>
<p>Both of these options only apply to new Java beans created using the Visual
Editor for Java. When an existing .java source file is opened, the Visual
Editor will make changes to the source code only as required to store new
property values or relationships between Java beans. Hence, any other code
within the file that relies on its internal structure or is not recognized
and used by the Visual Editor will be left unchanged.  </p>
<p>If you make your own changes to the Java source, they are parsed and analyzed
by the Visual Editor to determine whether they affect the Java beans and their
property values and relationships. If the newly modified source has changed
the Java beans, then the Design view, the Java beans view and the Properties
view are refreshed. Although the parsing and analysis of the source code is
done on background threads, it may have a performance impact when you make
changes to the code in the Source view. As you type in the Source view, the
parsing is not performed until you have stopped typing for half a second.
Using <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Java</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Visual Editor</span></span> you
can increase this delay time by changing the value ofÂ <var class="varname">Source
Synchronization Delay (msec)</var> to a larger value.</p>
