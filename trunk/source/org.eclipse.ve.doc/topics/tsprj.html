<h1 class="topictitle1">Keeping beans and BeanInfo classes in different projects</h1><div><div class="p"><p>When you develop classes in the Visual Editor for Java, you have
the option to keep your .java files and BeanInfo classes in different projects.
This enables you to easily develop and deploy the classes separately.</p>
<p>For
example, MyProject contains the class runtimeclasses.MyJavaBean. A second
project, MyBeanInfoProject, contains the package beaninfoclasses.MyJavaBeanBeanInfo.</p>
<p>Because
a BeanInfo class needs to know the class it represents, MyBeanInfoProject
must include MyProject in its Java build path. . Note that the reverse is
not true - MyProject should not include MyBeanInfoProject in its Java build
path, because this would create a circular reference.</p>
<p>To configure your
workbench setup so that BeanInfo classes are stored in a different project
from your .java files:</p>
</div><ol><li><span>Switch to the Java perspective</span></li><li><span>Right-click the project that contains the BeanInfo classes and
select  <b>Properties</b> from the pop-up menu. The Properties window opens.</span></li><li><span>Select  <b>Java Build Path</b>. Click the  <b>Projects</b> tab
and add the project that contains the Java beans (.java files) to the build
path. This defines the location of any classes required at run time that are
not part of the current project. You have now met the prerequisite explained
above. Close this Properties window.</span></li><li><span>Open the Properties window for the project that contains the .java
files and select  <b>BeanInfo</b>  <b>Path</b>. Click the  <b>BeanInfo</b>  <b>classes</b> tab.</span></li><li><span>Click the  <b>Add Projects</b> push button. A dialog box that lists
all available projects opens. You can use the text field at the top of the
dialog box to filter the list. Once you find the project containing the BeanInfo
classes select it and click  <b>OK</b>.</span></li><li><span>The project will now be included in the class path of the virtual
machine used for introspection, but you also need to specify the packages
that contain the BeanInfo classes. To do this, select the project that contains
the BeanInfo classes, and click the  <b>Modify Paths</b> push button. In the
Modify Searchpaths dialog box that opens, select the package containing the
BeanInfo class by clicking  <b>Choose Packages</b>. The Select Packages dialog
box opens, showing a tree view of packages inside the project.</span></li><li><span>Select the package that contains the BeanInfo classes. If there
is more than one package you can select them in turn. You can also use the
 <b>Up</b> and  <b>Down</b> push buttons to control the order in which they
will be searched.</span></li></ol><div class="p"><p>The steps to specify the location of a project's BeanInfo classes
when they are in another project are now complete.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul><li>If you develop classes in yet another project and they reference classes
in the project whose BeanInfo path you just configured (that is, the former
project has the latter on its Java build path), you must ensure that the project
containing the BeanInfo classes is exported. Otherwise, those classes will
not be found at introspection time. In the  <b>BeanInfo</b>  <b>Path</b> properties
for the project that contains the referenced beans, click the  <b>Order and
export</b> tab and confirm that the packages containing BeanInfo classes are
selected. Then select the  <b>Java Build Path</b> properties for the same
project and confirm that the packages containing the BeanInfo classes are
not excluded from export there. Excluding them here would override including
them on the BeanInfo Path page.</li>
<li>If a BeanInfo package export flag can't be changed, the given export status
is required. For example, if a package is not exported in the Java Build Path,
then it can't be exported in the BeanInfo search path and may also not be
set to not exported. This can happen if package is marked as exported in the
Java Build Path. For BeanInfo packages that come from non-java build path
locations, then the export flag can be changed. Also note that if you change
the Java Build path you need to close the properties dialog and reopen it
to see the changes in the BeanInfo path page. This is because the Java Build
path changes aren't actually applied until the window is closed.</li>
<li>Currently, by default, whenever an entry is added to the BeanInfo classes
it is not exported, so you must always go to the Order and Export page, and
explicitly export the entry.</li>
</ul>
