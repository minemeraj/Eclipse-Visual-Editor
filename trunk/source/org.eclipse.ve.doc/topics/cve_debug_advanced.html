<h1 class="topictitle1">Advanced options for debugging Java beans</h1>
<div><p>During normal development you should not need to be concerned with
the VM that is used by each visual editor instance. Advanced users, however,
can configure the workbench so that any messages sent to <tt class="sysout">System.out</tt> or <tt class="sysout">System.err</tt> of
the VM are written to the <span class="filepath">.log</span> file in the <span class="filepath">.metadata</span> directory
in your workspace.</p>
<p>The virtual machine (VM) that is used to execute the Java beans is not
the same VM that the workbench is running within. A separate VM is created
for each instance of the visual editor. The class path of this VM is set to
be the entries in the Java build path for the project. If while the visual
editor is open the Java build path is changed any open editors must be closed
and re-opened to reflect the updated build path.</p>
<p>When the workbench is started it can be given a -DEBUG option that points
to a text file:</p>
<p> <samp class="codeph">-DEBUG file:/c:/temp/options.txt</samp> </p>
<p>The debug file contains entries that are read by the visual editor. If
the file contains the following line then any messages sent to <tt class="sysout">System.out</tt> or <tt class="sysout">System.err</tt> are
shown in the console:</p>
<p> <samp class="codeph">org.eclipse.jem.proxy/remote/debug/vmtraceout=true</samp> </p>
<p>In addition to having console output shown from the VM used by the visual
editor you can start it in debug mode and perform remote debugging. This scenario
is not optimized and may change in future versions of the visual editor. However,
it is documented in case you need to perform debugging of your Java beans
at design time. To perform remote debugging you will need two workbenches
running: one with the Java beans that you want to debug, and one that can
perform socket based remote debugging. The second workbench could be running
on the same machine or a different machine. To enable debugging of the visual
editor's VM, the -DEBUG file should contain the line:</p>
<p> <tt class="sysout">org.eclipse.jem.proxy/remote/debug/debugvm=true</tt> </p>
<p>Each time the visual editor starts a VM it will ask you whether you want
it to be started in debug mode or not.</p>
<p><img src="../images/DebugJavaBeanDialog.gif" alt="" /> </p>
<p>The previous dialog is for when the class <tt class="sysout">HelloFrame.java</tt> in
the project Test is opened with the visual editor . If you select Yes, or
enter Y and press Enter in the console, then the VM is started in suspend
mode with the  <tt class="sysout">-Xdebug</tt> using a socket connector.
A free port is allocated. Then, you are told its number.</p>
<p><img src="../images/RemoteDebugJavaBeanDialog.gif" alt="" /> </p>
<p>The next step is to attach a remote debugger to port number 7078. The instance
of the workbench that is running the visual editor is suspended while the
remote debugger attaches, so you must use a debugger from another application.
If the other application is another instance of the workbench, you can begin
remote debugging by using the menu option <span class="uicontrol">Debug &gt; Debug</span> and
creating a new Remote Java Application configuration.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/RemoteDebuAttach.gif" alt="" /> </p>
<p>Enter the port number that was previously written to stdout, in this case
7078. If the debugger is on a different machine, in the <span class="uicontrol">Host</span> field
you should enter the IP address of the machine running the workbench that
is being debugged. To begin the remote debugger, click <span class="uicontrol">Debug</span> and
then enter <kbd class="userinput">y</kbd> in the stdin console of the workbench
being debugged.</p>
<p>In addition to being prompted to debug the VM used by each instance of
the visual editor , you will see messages that prompt you to debug the project
itself:</p>
<p> <tt class="sysout">Do you want to start the remote vm (Project (Test)-Beaninfo)
in debug mode? (Enter Y or N):</tt> </p>
<p>This is for the VM that is used for introspection and the  <tt class="sysout">java.beans.Introspector</tt> is
run in, and can be distinguished from the VM for the visual editor because
it does not specify a particular Java source file name. This VM is started
the first time any bean info is required for a Java bean within a project,
and remains active as long as the project remains open. By debugging this
project you can step through and analyze any code in your BeanInfo classes
as your Java beans are being introspected. Introspection occurs once for each
Java bean class for each project it is used in. The result is held in a cache
to help performance. If at any time you need to clear the cache of BeanInfo
information held for a project you can <span class="uicontrol">close</span> and <span class="uicontrol">open</span> the
project from its pop-up menu.</p>
