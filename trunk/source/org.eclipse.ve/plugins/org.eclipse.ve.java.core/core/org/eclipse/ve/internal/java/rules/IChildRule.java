	 * Rule to handle pre-creation of a child. The rule will normally handle annotations, 
	 * but overrides can handle more. At the time the command the rule returns is 
	 * executed, the annotations need to be attached to the child (or grandchildren)
	 * so that they can be found. They don't need to be attached at the time the
	 * command is returned from the rule.
	 * 
	 * The command should be placed before the actual add of the child to the parent
	 * so that annotation and scoping can be done correctly before the actual add child
	 * is done.
	 * 
	 * @param  domain The domain of the application.
	 * @param  target The target of the child. It must already be contained in a resource
	 *                 by the time the command is executed. It does not
	 *                 need to be contained when requesting the command thru the rule. Therefore
	 *                 any rule override MUST return a command that will not do any checking of containment
	 *                 until actual execution. It cannot do containment checks during prepare/canExecute.
	 *                 If not contained by time of execution it may or may not permit scoping. That
	 *                 is rule implementation specific, a specific implementation may be able to handle this.
	 * @param  newValue The new child that needs to be added.
	 * @param  feature The feature that is being set with the new value. 
	 * 
	 * @return a command that will perform the preCreate.

	 * something from the domain. It will walk through all of the
	 * children and PostSet them too.
	 * 
	 * This should be called only if the child had been set and was not a touch.
	 * If the child wasn't set, or it was a touch, then the old value is still valid.
	 * 
     * Since it will walk through children it is best to call this at the
     * highest point in the tree of properties as possible. If you are unsetting
     * a child which contains other properties, don't call postSet on any
     * of the children properties because that would be duplicate effort and
     * not needed.
