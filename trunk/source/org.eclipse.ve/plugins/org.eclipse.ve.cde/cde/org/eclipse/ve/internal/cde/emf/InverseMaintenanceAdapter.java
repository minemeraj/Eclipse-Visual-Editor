/**
 * This is used to maintain anonymous shared inverse relationships. For instance,
 * maintain back-pointers to all EObjects (and the appropriate feature) that
 * point to this EObject. This is a self-propagating adapter, starting with
 * top EObject it will propagate itself down to referenced EObjects. It will not
 * propagate to AnnotationEMF objects (since that object maintains its own back-pointer).
 * It will propagate itself to owned EObjects, but won't insert itself into the back list
 * since that is not a shared relationship.
 * 
 * Add ResourceInverseMaintenanceAdapter to a Resource when you want all EObjects in the
 * resource to have an inverse maintained on them. If you add it to an EObject only, then
 * it will be propagated down to containment references only. An adapter will be added to
 * shared references following the algorithm below, but such adapters won't propagate down
 * to its references until it gets added to a containment reference of an EObject that has been
 * propagated (or until that EObject gets added to one that has and so on up the chain).
 * After adding it to an EObject you will need to call propagate() method, otherwise it won't 
 * know to propagate down. This is not necessary when adding ResourceInverseMaintenanceAdapter. 
 * It will cause a propagation to occur immediately. 
 *  
 * NOTE: Propagation will not be allowed until after the object has been contained within a resource.
 * This allows the cross doc control to work correctly. So do not call propagate until the object is in
 * a resource.
 *  
 * 
 * Propagation and cross reference works in this manner (source is the inverse adapter/eobject that 
 * the setting is being made to, target is the inverse adapter/eobject that is the setting). This
 * algorithm runs through the inverse adapter of the source. If the source doesn't have an inverse adapter
 * then nothing happens since it is the source that detects the setting occurring, not the target:
 * 
 * (A) ref is a shared reference, source has propagated and shouldReference is true:
 *     (if source has not yet propagated then nothing happens to target because
 *      this will be handled at the time the source is propagated):
 *   1) If target has an inverse adapter, the back ref will simply be added to it.
 *   2) If target does not have an inverse adapter and shouldAddAdapter is true:
 *      a) source and target are in different resources and allowCrossDoc is false then inverse adapter not created
 *      b) source and target are in different resources and allowCrossDoc is true, then inverse adapter is created
 *         and a back ref added.
 *      c) target is not in a resource, then inverse adapter is created and a back ref added. 
 *         (This is because we don't know at this point whether ir will be in a different resource or not, and we don't
 *          want to loose this reference when it is finally in a resource).
 *      d) source and target are in same resource, then inverse adapter is created and a back ref added. 
 * 
 * (B) ref is a containment reference (which means target is contained by source), source has propagated:
 *     (if source has not yet propagated then nothing happens to target because
 *      this will be handled at the time the source is propagated):
 *   1) If target has an inverse adapter and not yet propagated, it will be propagated.
 *   2) If target does not have an inverse adapter and shouldPropagate is true, one will be created and it will be propagated.
 * 
 * (C) Propagate means adapter will mark itself as propagated and then run through all of its references and
 *     process them as in (A) and (B) appropriately.
 * 
 * The above algorithm may cause some unexpected actions. Propagation is only done when added to a source
 * that has propagated, or when that source is propagated. So there may be an inverse adapter on an object (target) that
 * has not propagated to it settings. So it will show only back refs to those sources that have propagated. It would
 * stick out like a leaf even though it may have settings. None of its settings will have back refs to it. You also can
 * still get a cross doc reference if the target was not contained by a resource at the time it was pointed to by 
 * a source that had been propagated. So it is best not to point to something until that something has been contained if
 * the source has been propagated and contained.
