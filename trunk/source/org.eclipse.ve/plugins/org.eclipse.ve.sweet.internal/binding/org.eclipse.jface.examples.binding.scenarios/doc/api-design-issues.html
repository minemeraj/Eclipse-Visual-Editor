<h2>Update Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Default update policy should be on focus lost</li>
<li>Where do you set the update policy?
There are two basic choices: Set the update policy on the
binding context (applies to the binding of several widgets),
or on each bind() call (makes it easy to change policy for
each binding)</li>
<li></li>
