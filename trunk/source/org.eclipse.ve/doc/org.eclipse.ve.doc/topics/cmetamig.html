<h1 class="topictitle1">Metadata and migrating from VisualAge for Java</h1>
<div><p>When you make changes to a Java bean using the Visual Editor for Java,
the source code is updated to reflect the changes. The source code changes
are reflected in <tt class="sysout">set</tt> methods that change property
values. However, some information used by the Visual Editor for Java is not
stored in properties because it is only required at design time. This includes
the position of a Java bean on the free form surface.</p>
<p>To store this information so that the Visual Editor for Java can be reopened
with the Java bean at the same position, it is placed in a comment on the
line that declares the Java bean. The statement below shows a Java bean representing
a JFrame that is positioned at 16,17.</p>
<pre>private javax.swing.JFrame ivjJFrame = null; // @jve:visual-info
decl-index=0 visual-constraint="16,17"</pre>
<p>The comment representing the position of a Java bean is not required, and
if no comment is present then a default position is allocated when the Visual
Editor for Java is opened. This only applies to top level Java beans that
are not contained within another and does not affect the placement of components
within a container. The location of components within a container is determined
by the container's layout manager and the component's bounds or constraints.
 </p>
<p>In VisualAge for Java, the position of the top level Java beans (also referred
to as free form parts) is not present in the source code. So, if you migrate
a file that was written using VisualAge for Java's Visual Composition Editor
(VCE), default positions are used. If you wish to keep the positional information,
then you can obtain a migration utility that is loaded into VisualAge for
Java. It allows you to regenerate your classes with the position stored in
a comment format. To get the utility, download the latest  <b>VCE Code Generation/Export
Wizard</b> from <a href="http://www7.software.ibm.com/vad.nsf/data/document4293" target="_blank">www7.software.ibm.com/vad.nsf/data/document4293</a></p>
<p>This migration utility is available as a tempfix that can be installed
using VAJava's FixManager  <b>Workspace &gt; Tools &gt; FixManager</b>. The utility
will allow you to migrate and export classes that have been developed using
VisualAge for Java's VCE to a format suitable for the Visual Editor. After
installing this patch you can select a menu item called  <b>VCE Code Generation/Export...</b> from
the pop-up menu of projects, packages, or classes. Selecting this item will
launch a wizard that allows you to regenerate the code for classes that have
been previously saved with the VCE. The free form positions will be saved
in the comment format used by the Visual Editor.</p>
<p>If you have connections, we recommend you first regenerate this code using
the Event Handling's third option of the VCE code generation options (i.e.
'Use an inner class for each event') before running this utility. However,
some classes will not be able to be converted to this style due to a bug in
VisualAge for Java. In this case, you should convert to style 2. The wizard
also gives you the option to export the classes to a directory once the code
generation is complete. Note that the Visual Editor for Java events support
will not parse the old VCE style 1 ('Do not use any inner classes') pattern.
Notice how you can set the code generation styles 1, 2, and 3:  <br /><img src="../images/VCEpattern1.gif" alt="VCE pattern 1" /><br />  <br /><img src="../images/VCEpattern2.gif" alt="VCE pattern 2" /><br /></p>
<p>Since the VCE maintained its own model of the Java beans and their property
values and relationships, it always regenerated the source in a top-down fashion
from this model. Any modifications made by a user to the source were limited
to pre-defined user code points in the source delimited by comments  <samp class="codeph">//user
code begin {1}</samp> and  <samp class="codeph">//user code end.</samp> Also, to indicate
that the methods for the Java beans would be regenerated each time code generation
was performed, the line  <samp class="codeph">/* WARNING: THIS METHOD WILL BE REGENERATED.
*/</samp> was added to the method comment. The migration utility has an
option that will remove these VCE generated comments from the exported code
(not the source code in VisualAge for Java), as they are no longer applicable outside
the VCE. However, once the comments for the user code points
have been removed from the source, the user code cannot be used within VisualAge
for Java. The reason is that the presence of these comments is what protects
the user code from being overwritten.</p>
<p>The Visual Editor for Java does not use a persistent object model for its
Java beans and their property values and relationships, and instead parses
the source each time. For this reason, the comments for user code points and
for specifying method regeneration no longer apply, and modifications can
be made freely to the source code. If the modifications alter the source code
structure so that the Visual Editor for Java can no longer recognize the structure
of the Java beans, you may not see them in the Design view or the Java beans
list. However, the source will not be altered to suit the editor's style,
and your changes will be preserved.</p>
