<h1 class="topictitle1">Containers and layout managers</h1>
<div><p>Some Java beans allow relationships between themselves. For example, the
class java.awt.Container allows instances of java.awt.Component to be added
to it as part of its components relationship. An example of java.awt.Container
is a panel or a frame. An example of java.awt.Component is a button or a text
box. In the Visual Editor for Java, containment relationships are shown in
the Java Beans view and in the Design view.</p>
<p>A layout manager is an object that controls the size and position of components
within a container. You can choose to set the layout manager on a container
to null, thereby allowing each component to size and position itself. However,
the position of the GUI components will not correspond to the changes you
make when you resize the window. Rather than having a fixed size and position
for each component, the container will delegate the sizing and positioning
of its components by using a layout manager.</p>
<p>Each layout manager has its own rules for distributing the components,
but most place each component so that they are at least as big as their preferred
size. The preferred size of components with user visible strings, such as
button or label, is calculated dynamically. So, as the string length changes
due to different locales or fonts, the layout manager will reposition each
component. As the window is resized by the user at runtime, a layout manager
will also reposition each component to optimize the new overall size. This
makes layout managers invaluable for building GUIs that will be deployed in
an environment where label strings, fonts, or window size may vary.</p>
<p>The Visual Editor allows you to set the layout manager of a container to:</p>
<ul><li>null</li>
<li>java.awt.FlowLayout</li>
<li>java.awt.BorderLayout</li>
<li>java.awt.GridLayout</li>
<li>java.awt.GridBagLayout</li>
<li>java.awt.CardLayout.</li>
<li>java.awt.BoxLayout</li>
</ul>
<p>These topics are covered separately in the documentation.</p>
<p>If you use a layout manager not supplied in the Visual Editor, the Design
view will still construct the container correctly and render the components.
However, you won't be able to update constraints using the Properties view
or Design view.</p>
