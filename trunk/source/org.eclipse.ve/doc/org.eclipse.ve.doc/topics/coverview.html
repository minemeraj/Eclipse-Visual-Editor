<h1 class="topictitle1">Visual Editor for Java</h1>
<div><p>The Visual Editor for Java is a code-centric editor that helps you design
applications containing a graphical user interface (GUI). It is based on the
JavaBeans component model and supports visual construction using either the
Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) or Swing.</p>
<p>The Visual Editor for Java provides limited visual support for AWT menus.
The Visual Editor does provide visualization support for JMenus.</p>
<p>If you are using SINE, you must set the Aventail software to ignore java.exe
in order for the Visual Editor for Java to work properly. </p>
<p>You can use the Visual Editor for Java to create a class that includes
pre-defined Java beans from the palette. This class can be a runnable class
or it can be a Java bean that you intend to include in another class. To be
used as a Java bean by the Visual Editor for Java there is no interface that
must be implemented and the only requirement is that the editor knows how
to instantiate the class. For most purposes this means that the class should
be public and have a public null constructor. The null constructor can be
explicit or implicit, although there are a few exceptions that the Visual
Editor for Java recognizes such as java.awt.Dialog subclasses. They are instantiated
using the constructor that takes an argument of java.awt.Frame. The Visual
Editor adds an explicit constructor that calls the initialize method, which
is used to set up the initial state of the Java bean.</p>
<p>The IDE has a number of editors that can be used to edit a .java source
file. The Java Editor lets you write your source manually, while the Visual
Editor combines this with a design area that lets you lay out and preview
any visual JavaBeans.</p>
<p>The Visual Editor is designed to work with .java source, letting you edit
the source and the design simultaneously. Therefore, it does not have its
own perspective. If you use the Visual Editor in the Java perspective, any
customization you have made to the position of the Tasks view, the Console
view and the Outline view are used by the Visual Editor for Java as well as
the Java Editor.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle"> Design and source windows </h4><p>The Visual
Editor for Java editor is divided into two windows, one showing the Java beans
in a design window, and the other showing the associated source. In the design
window, Java beans that are AWT or Swing widgets are shown graphically. As
you modify the Java beans in the design window, the source is updated. Conversely,
as you change the source files, the design window is updated to reflect the
changes you make. This round tripping of the design and source windows is
designed so that the Visual Editor for Java can be used not only as a tool
to generate code, but as an editor to show the effect of source code modifications
during development. After you make changes to your .java file source in another
editor, your changes will be reflected in the design window of the Visual
Editor.</p>
<p>The Visual Editor for Java, by default, shows the design window
above the source window on a split pane. The design pane is a WYSIWYG surface
that lets you compose the GUI you are building, while the source pane shows
the contents of the Java file. The design window has a palette on the left
that allows you to control selection of Java beans. At any time you can use
the undo option from the edit menu or the toolbar action  <img src="../images/UndoAction.gif" alt="undo action" /> to undo a change.</p>
<p>You can change the default so
that the design and source windows have notebook tabs, allowing you to click
back and forth between them. To change the default, click  <b>Window &gt; Preferences
&gt; Java &gt; Visual Editor</b>. Select the  <b>Appearance</b> tab, then click
 <b>On Separate notebook tabs</b>. Close the Visual Editor Java, then open
it again to refresh your preference change.</p>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle"> Properties view and Java beans view </h4><p>There are
two additional views that are not included in the standard Java Perspective
but are used by the Visual Editor for Java. These are the Properties view
and the Java beans view that are automatically activated when the Visual Editor
opens.</p>
<p>The Java Beans view is a tree that shows the components used
by the GUI. The Properties view shows the properties for the selected Java
bean. The design window and the Java Beans view show the Java beans that are
being used by the class being composed. When you subclass a Java bean, such
as  <tt class="sysout">HelloFrame</tt> that subclasses  <samp class="codeph">javax.swing.JFrame</samp>,
a special part called  <var class="varname">this</var> is shown on the Design view
and the Java Beans view.  <var class="varname">This</var> represents the instance
of the class itself that is being composed and cannot be deleted.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/HelloFrameFirstOpen.gif" alt="Java perspective with Visual Editor" /> </p>
<p>Visual
beans that are subclasses of  <samp class="codeph">java.awt.Component</samp>, such as
 <samp class="codeph">javax.swing.JFrame</samp>, are shown in the Design view with their
graphical representation, so that as you edit the class you can preview how
it will look at runtime. The class  <samp class="codeph">java.awt.Component</samp> has
a  <tt class="sysout">preferredSize</tt> property. You can specify an
explicit size for each subclass to indicate the size at runtime. By default,
the Design view figure shows the  <tt class="sysout">preferredSize</tt> unless
an explicit size has been set. The  <tt class="sysout">HelloFrame</tt> instance
is shown at its preferred size above.</p>
<p>The Properties view shows a list
of Java bean properties for the selected Java beans in either the Design view
or the Java Beans view. The list of these properties comes from introspection
of the Java beans and is covered more in the section on updating properties.
Each property usually has a get and set method associated with it and the
value of each property is shown in the Properties view. To see the list of
properties it may be necessary to enlarge the property sheet by making the
workbench window larger or dragging the left edge of the Properties view.</p>
<p>To
see the synchronization between views you can change the title of the frame.
In the Properties view this is done by selecting the 'title' property and
entering a new value. The new title will be shown in the graphical canvas
figure of the frame, and also a setTitle() method will be generated in the
source. In addition to top down changes, where a change causes the source
to be changed, you can change the source directly. Changing the String argument
of the setTitle() method will cause the value shown in the Design view and
the Properties view to be updated as well. This is a bottom up change from
the source to the other views, and the ability to make changes from any of
the views and have the others kept in sync is the round tripping feature of
the Visual Editor for Java.</p>
