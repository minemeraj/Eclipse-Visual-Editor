<h1 class="topictitle1">JTable and its columns</h1>
<div><p>You can use the visual editor to arrange data in rows and columns
using JTable.</p>
<p>The class javax.swing.JTable has a model property that is responsible for
retrieving and formatting data. The model property is associated with the
javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel model. If you write your own Java code
to assign a table model, the visual editor will parse the source and attempt
to instantiate and apply the table model to the instance of the JTable in
the Design view.</p>
<p>The columns in a JTable can either be explicitly added to the JTable, or
can be calculated based on the number of table model columns. The default
value of the boolean property  <tt class="sysout">autoCreateColumnsFromModel</tt> is
'true'. This means that the JTable will create as many columns as the table
model returns from the  <tt class="sysout">getColumnCount()</tt> method.</p>
<p>If you want more control over the table columns, you can set the property
autoCreateColumnsFromModel to false, then manually add the columns. Each column
is an instance of the class <tt class="sysout">javax.swing.table.TableColumn</tt> and
can be selected from the palette. You can add new TableColumns to a JTable
by dropping them on the Java Beans view. You can also select a TableColumn
in the Java Beans view to change its properties in the Properties view.</p>
<p>The Design view lets you see the column with some preview data to help
you determine its size, but you cannot select or size a column in the Design
view. You must select it in the Java Beans view to change its properties.
A table model with 'dummy data' of five empty rows is used to show preview
data when the JTable's table model is set to its default value. When a table
model has been explicitly provided, either in code that the visual editor
 parses or because the JTable's value has been overridden, then the dummy
table model is not used. If a table model is supplied in code for it to be
successfully previewed in the Design view, it must follow the rules for construction
that the visual editor recognizes. The JTable must be in a JScrollPane for
the table headers to appear. Also, you can use the JTable on JScrollPane option
on the palette .</p>
