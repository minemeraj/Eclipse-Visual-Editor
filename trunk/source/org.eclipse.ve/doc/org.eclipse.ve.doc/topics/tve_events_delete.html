<h1 class="topictitle1">Deleting events from a component</h1>
<div><p>You can use the Java Beans view to delete an event that you added
to a component in the visual editor for Java.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip: </span>If you do not see any events in the Java Beans view,
make sure that you click the Java Beans view menu arrow and select <span class="uicontrol">Show
Events</span> to show events, or select <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> to
show events, adapters, and listeners.</div>
<p>To delete an event from a component,
do one of the following:</p>
</div>
<ul><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Java Beans view, select the event and press the Delete key.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Java Beans view, right-click the event and select <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span> from
the context pop-up menu.</span> <ul><li>In <span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span> mode, this will remove from the
Java source the callback method for the event.  If the listener class
implements an interface that requires a method body for compilation, then
the method contents are cleared out, rather than removing the method entirely.<p><img src="../images/DeleteWindowClosed_01.gif" alt="delete window closed" /></p>
<p>If after you delete the callback method there are no remaining
method body implementations on the listener and if the listener is an anonymous
inner class, then the listener itself is removed with the method that registers
it with the source. In the previous example, the Window listener only
has a windowOpened callback, so when windowOpened is deleted the listener
and the <samp class="codeph">addWindowListener(...)</samp>  statement that adds
it to the source will be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>In <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> mode, when a callback method is
deleted it is removed from the listener, or replaced with an empty method
body if the listener implements the interface and must have a method to successfully
compile. Unlike in <span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span> mode, no cascaded
delete of the listener is done, so even if the listener has no remaining callback
method bodies left is it not automatically removed.<br /><img src="../images/DeleteExpertMode_01.gif" alt="delete expert mode" /><br /><p>Delete
in <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> mode can be thought of as deleting
the selected tree item from its parent.</p>
<p>The listener itself can also
be selected and deleted. This will remove the listener from the Java
Bean. If the listener is an anonymous inner class it will be removed
from the source. However, for a name listener class it will still remain after
it has been removed from Java beans that use it.<br /><img src="../images/DeleteExpertMode_02.gif" alt="delete expert mode" /><br /></p>
