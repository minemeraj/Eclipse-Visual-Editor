<h1 class="topictitle1">Code migration from VisualAge for Java to the visual editor</h1>
<div><p>This topic provides information about migrating Java code from
VisualAge for Java.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a Java component using the visual editor for Java,
the source code is updated to reflect the changes. The source code changes
are reflected in <tt class="sysout">set</tt> methods that change property
values. However, some information used by the visual editor for Java is not
stored in properties because it is only required at design time. This information
includes the position of a Java bean on the free form surface.</p>
<p>To store this information so that the visual editor for Java can be reopened
with the Java bean at the same position, the information is placed in a comment
on the line that declares the Java bean. The following statement shows a JFrame
component that is positioned at 16,17:</p>
<pre>private javax.swing.JFrame ivjJFrame = null; // @jve:visual-info
decl-index=0 visual-constraint="16,17"</pre>
<p>The comment representing the position of a component is not required, and
if no comment is present then a default position is allocated when the visual
editor for Java is opened. This default placement only applies to top level
Java beans that are not contained within another and does not affect the placement
of components within a container. The location of components within a container
is determined by the container's layout manager and the component's bounds
or constraints.  </p>
<p>In VisualAge for Java, the position of the top level Java beans (also referred
to as free form parts) is not present in the source code. If you migrate a
file that was written using VisualAge for Java's Visual Composition Editor
(VCE), default positions are used. If you want to keep the positional information,
then you can obtain a migration utility that is loaded into VisualAge for
Java. The migration utility regenerates your classes with the position stored
in a comment format. To get the utility, download the latest <strong>Conversion
tool for VisualAge for Java Visual Composition Editor applications</strong> from <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/us/search/index.html" target="_blank">www.ibm.com/support/us/</a></p>
<p>This migration utility is available as a tempfix that can be installed
using VisualAge for Java's FixManager (from <span class="uicontrol">Workspace &gt; Tools &gt;
FixManager</span>). The utility migrates and exports classes that have
been developed using VisualAge for Java's VCE to a format suitable for the
visual editor. After installing this patch you can select <span class="uicontrol">VCE Code
Generation/Export...</span> from the pop-up menu for projects, packages,
or classes. Selecting this item launches a wizard that can regenerate the
code for classes that have been previously saved with the VCE. The free form
positions are saved in the comment format used by the visual editor.</p>
<p>If you have connections, you can first regenerate this code by selecting
the <span class="uicontrol">Use an inner class for each event</span> VCE code generation
option before running this utility. However, some classes will not be able
to be converted to this style due to a bug in VisualAge for Java. In this
case, you should use the <span class="uicontrol">Use one inner class for all events</span> VCE
code generation option. The wizard also gives you the option to export the
classes to a directory after the code generation is complete. The visual editor
for Java events support will not parse the <span class="uicontrol">Do not use any inner
classes</span> VCE code generation style.</p>

<p>Since the VCE maintained its own model of the Java beans and their property
values and relationships, it always regenerated the source in a top-down fashion
from this model. Any modifications made by a user to the source were limited
to pre-defined user code points in the source delimited by comments  <samp class="codeph">//user
code begin {1}</samp> and  <samp class="codeph">//user code end.</samp> Also, to indicate
that the methods for the Java beans were regenerated each time code generation
was performed, the line  <samp class="codeph">/* WARNING: THIS METHOD WILL BE REGENERATED.
*/</samp> was added to the method comment. The migration utility has an
option that removes these VCE-generated comments from the exported code (not
the source code in VisualAge for Java), as they are no longer applicable outside
the VCE. However, once the comments for the user code points have been removed
from the source, the user code cannot be used within VisualAge for Java. The
reason is that the presence of these comments is what protects the user code
from being overwritten.</p>
<p>The visual editor for Java does not use a persistent object model for its
Java beans and their property values and relationships, but rather parses
the source each time. For this reason, the comments for user code points and
for specifying method regeneration no longer apply, and modifications can
be made freely to the source code. If the modifications alter the source code
structure so that the visual editor for Java can no longer recognize the structure
of the Java beans, you might not see them in the Design view or the Java Beans
view. However, the source will not be altered to suit the editor's style,
and your changes will be preserved.</p>
