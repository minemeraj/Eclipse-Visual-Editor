<h1 class="topictitle1">Events, listeners, and adapter classes</h1>
<div><p>JavaBeans events are signalled when an activity occurs, such as
a button being pressed or a window being closed. The visual editor for Java
 shows events in the Java Beans view, and you can use this view to add and
remove events.</p>
<p>The list of defined events for a JavaBean is described in its BeanInfo
class, which also controls the commonly used or preferred events.</p>
<p>You might want to add an event to a JavaBean if you want something to happen
when the JavaBean is generated, such as a database update when a button is
pushed. The Java Bean raising the event is the source, and the object that
gets called back when the event is raised is known as the  <var class="varname">listener</var>.
Each JavaBean has an interface that allows it to notify the listeners for
each event, as well as methods to add and remove listeners.</p>
<p>Typically, if the source JavaBean has a method XXX, there is a listener
interface, XXXListener, and two methods. It is important that XXXListener
extends java.util.EventListener. If it does not, and unless a specific BeanInfo
is supplied, the event will not be discovered.</p>
<ul><li>addXXXListener(XXXListener aListener)</li>
<li>removeXXXListener(XXXListener aListener)</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods on the XXXListener interface itself depend on the semantics
of the event, but the convention is that their signature is <samp class="codeph">void &lt;eventOccurenceMethodName&gt;(&lt;EventStateObjectType&gt;
evt);</samp>. It is important that XXXListener extends java.util.EventObject.
If it does not, and unless a specific BeanInfo is supplied, the event will
not be discovered.</p>
<p>An example of an event is the JavaBean java.awt.Component, which raises
events when the mouse moves over it. The listener interface, java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener,
implements the following two methods:</p>
<ul><li>void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt);</li>
<li>void mouseMoved(MouseEvent evt);</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a mouse listener, the java.awt.Component has the following two methods:
 </p>
<ul><li>public void addMouseListener(MouseListener evt);</li>
<li>public void removeMouseListener(MouseListener listener);</li>
</ul>
<p>The second style of event is generated by a JavaBean when a property value
changes. An example of this is the 'enabled' property on javax.swing.JButton.
A property that fires an event when its value is changed is known as a bound
property. Instead of having a separate listener interface for each bound property,
there is a generic listener interface  <samp class="codeph">java.beans.PropertyChangeListener</samp> which
has a single callback method <samp class="codeph">void propertyCanged(PropertyChangeEvent
evt);</samp> The argument PropertyChangeEvent has three methods that can
be queried by the receiver of the method:  </p>

<div class="tablenoborder"><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" frame="border" border="1" rules="all"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">String getPropertyName()</td>
<td valign="top">The name of the property that was changed on the JavaBean that caused
the event to fire</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Object getNewValue()</td>
<td valign="top">The new value of the property</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Object getOldValue()</td>
<td valign="top">The value of the property before it was changed</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>To register interest in a JavaBean's property changes there are two methods: <samp class="codeph">void
addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener);</samp> <samp class="codeph">void
addPropertyChangeListener(String propertyName, PropertyChangeListener listener);</samp></p>
<p>The first of these methods is always present on a JavaBean that has bound
properties. However, the second is optional and depends on the style of event
registration used by author of the JavaBean. For example, AWT components use
the first style of property change registration, while Swing components use
both styles.</p>
<p>To use an event there are three objects:</p>
<ol><li>The JavaBean that raises the event ( the source )</li>
<li>The class that receives notification from the source ( the listener )</li>
<li>The class that implements the logic that occurs when the listener is called
back.</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually the last two are combined, so that the class that executes the
logic either implements the listener interface directly or uses an inner class.
The styles of code that the visual editor for Java recognizes and generates
are covered in the section on Event Code Generation.  </p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Adapter classes</h4><p>Many listener interfaces have more
than one callback method. An example is java.awt.FocusListener that has two
methods; focusGained(java.awt.FocusEvent event) and focusLost(java.awt.FocusEvent
event). When creating a listener class that implements the interface the Java
compiler insists that all of the interface methods are implemented, which
often results in many empty methods being created to satisfy its requirements
when only one or some of its methods actually contain code. The following
statement shows a FocusListener being used to perform some logic when a Java
bean gains focus. However, an empty focusLost method must be provided.</p>
<div class="p"> <pre>javaBean.addFocusListener(new java.awt.event.FocusListener() {      
    public void focusGained(java.awt.event.FocusEvent e) {          
        doFocusGainedCode();      
     }          
        public void focusLost(java.awt.event.FocusEvent e) {      
     }  
});</pre>
</div>
<p>To avoid having many empty listener methods for many
listeners, Adapter classes are provided. These implement the listener interface,
and provide empty no-op implementation of its methods. The advantage is that
the listener can extend these, and only specialize methods of choice without
having to provide default implementations for the rest ( these are inherited
from the Adapter ).</p>
<div class="p"><pre>javaBean.addFocusListener(new java.awt.event.FocusAdapter() {     
     public void focusGained(java.awt.event.FocusEvent e) {          
         doFocusGainedCode();      
         }  
   });</pre>
