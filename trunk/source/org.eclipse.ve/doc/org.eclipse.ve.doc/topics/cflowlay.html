<h1 class="topictitle1">Flow layout manager</h1>
<div><p>The flow layout manager sizes each component according to its preferred
size and arranges them in horizontal wrapping lines. It sizes each component
dynamically and positions them so that they are evenly spaced. The advantages
of the flow layout manager include its ease of use, and the guarantee that
each component can be seen.</p>
<p>To see an example of the flow layout manager in the Visual Editor for Java,
drop a JPanel class onto the Design view and then use the palette to select
a JButton bean. The default layout manager of a JPanel is  <tt class="sysout">java.awt.FlowLayout</tt> When
you drop this first bean you will see the drop cursor, and a rectangle just
inside the container's boundaries as you drag the loaded cursor over it. This
target feedback is drawn even on a populated container.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/FlowLayoutDropFirstButtonStart.gif" alt="drop cursor with no feedback" /> </p>
<p>After you drop the button it does not appear beneath the cursor, but where
the layout manager has positioned it. Although it may seem that the editor
ignored your mouse position when you performed the drop, this is not the case.
The Design view reflects the flow layout manager behavior or the specified
layout manager behavior. This behavior where the component is not placed directly
beneath the mouse is a general feature of all layout managers. Based on where
the mouse is, the Visual Editor will attempt to generate code that places
the new component close to the desired location. However, the final positioning
of the component is determined by the layout manager itself.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/FlowLayoutDropFirstButtonEnd.gif" alt="button position determined by layout manager" /> </p>
<p>There is target feedback when a second component is dropped, because it
can be dropped with a position relative to the existing components. If you
select another component such as JLabel, you will see a vertical bar either
to the left or to the right of the JButton bean, depending on where the cursor
is.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/FlowLayoutDropJLabelStart.gif" alt="drop cursor with placement feedback" /> </p>
<p>When you release mouse button one to complete the drop operation the JLabel
bean will be positioned to the left of the JButton bean.Â </p>
<p> <img src="../images/FlowLayoutDropJLabelEnd.gif" alt="label position to left of button" /> </p>
<p>By default, the generated code will order the  <tt class="sysout">add()</tt> expressions
to reflect the placement order. You can explicitly set the position of a component
using an index as an argument to the  <tt class="sysout">add()</tt> expression.
In addition to specifying the position of a component during a drop operation,
you can select a component and change its order relative to the other components
in the container using the Design view or the Java Beans view. When you reorder
a component, you are actually changing the order in which it is added to its
parent container. This can be seen by the calls to the  <tt class="sysout">add
(Component, Object)</tt> method for the JPanel class:</p>
<pre>this.add(getJLabel(), null);
this.add(getJButton(), null);</pre>
<p>Since the Visual Editor for Java has incremental round-tripping from the
source to the Design view, you can also reorder the components by editing
the order of the methods directly in the Java source view. You can also change
the add methods to be  <tt class="sysout">add(Component comp , int index )</tt></p>
<p>; setting explicit indexes to each component that are independent of the
creation order.  </p>
<p>The flow layout manager sizes each component according to its preferred
size. As the preferred size changes the Design view will reflect the change.
For example, you can change the text of a button and it will automatically
become larger to accomodate the new string. This is shown below where the
JButton bean's text property was changed to the string  <tt class="sysout">OK</tt>.
After changing the text of the button you will its size increase. The position
of it and other components is adjusted to keep them evenly spaced. That is,
the layout is reflowed.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/FlowLayoutButtonOKText.gif" alt="button sized to fit label" /> </p>
<p>Since the preferred size for some components is initially a dimension of
0,0 they might be too small to see in the Design view. So, when a JLabel bean
is first dropped on the Design view its text property is initially set to
the string  <tt class="sysout">JLabel</tt>. Likewise, when an AWT Label
bean is first dropped, its label property is set to  <tt class="sysout">Label</tt>.</p>
<p>The flow layout class has its own properties that let you control the spacing
of the components, and the flow from the center, the left, or the right side
of the container. The value of these properties can be viewed and changed
by expanding the  <b>layout</b> property in the Properties view.</p>
