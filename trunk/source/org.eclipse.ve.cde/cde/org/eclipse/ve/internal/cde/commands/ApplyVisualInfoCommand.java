/**
 * This command is used to apply settings to a VisualInfo. If the VisualInfo or
 * the Annotation doesn't exist, it will create them as needed.
 *
 * The setting may be either a KeyedValue or a Point, Dimension, or Rectangle.
 * If it is not a KeyedValue, it will apply it as a VisualConstraint and use
 * the VisualConstraint key.
 *
 * This command is used because creating the necessary annotation and visual info
 * can be complicated. It also allows this to go into a compound command where previously
 * in the command the annotation and visual info may of been created, but at the time
 * the command was constructed these weren't available. By putting this command after
 * those commands, the visual info will be available and it won't need to be created in
 * this command.
 *
 * An example of where this would be used is in the create request case. When the create request
 * is creating the commands, the annotation may not yet be live, and so the command to add the
 * appropriate constraint can't be found at that time. However, when the create request command
 * is executed, it will be available. So if this command is placed after the commands for the
 * create request the create request command will first create the annotion, then this command will
 * have an annotation to work with (and so it won't create one).
