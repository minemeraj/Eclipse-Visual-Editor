/**
 * This command is used to apply settings to an Annotation. If the 
 * Annotation doesn't exist, it will create it as needed.
 *
 * The setting is a BasicEMap.Entry.
 *
 * This command is used because creating the necessary annotation 
 * can be complicated. It also allows this to go into a compound command where previously
 * in the command the annotation may of been created, but at the time
 * the command was constructed it wasn't available. By putting this command after
 * those commands, the annotation will be available and it won't need to be created in
 * this command.
 *
 * An example of where this would be used is in the create request case. When the create request
 * is creating the commands, the annotation may not yet be live, and so the annotation to add the
 * appropriate value can't be found at that time. However, when the create request command
 * is executed, it will be available. So if this command is placed after the commands for the
 * create request the create request command will first create the annotion, then this command will
 * have an annotation to work with (and so it won't create one).
