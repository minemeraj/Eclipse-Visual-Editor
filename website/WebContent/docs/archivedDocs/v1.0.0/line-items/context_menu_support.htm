<h2>Context Menu Support</h2>
<p><b>Eclipse Popup Extensions</b></p>
<p>Context menus (or popup menus) are provided via the Eclipse extension point
<b>org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus </b>and need to be added for various SWT controls:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="tabfolder.htm">TabFolder</a> - <b>Switch To </b>- allow switching 
  between the various pages of the notebook</li>
  <li>Composite - null layout - <b>Show Grid/Hide Grid</b> - show and hide a 
  grid of dots that allow the user to snap controls to a grid position within 
  the composite. This helps with control alignment within the composite.</li>
  <li>Direct edit capability - <b>setText</b> capability allows the user to 
  change the text of a control without having to find the property in the 
  property sheet viewer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ObjectActionDelegates</b></p>
<p><b>IObjectActionDelegate</b> is an Interface for an object action that is 
contributed into a popup menu for a view or editor. It extends <b>
IActionDelegate</b> and adds an initialization method for connecting the 
delegate to the part it should work with. This are used in conjunction with the 
Eclipse popup extensions to delegate selections and editor changes to the 
actions specified.</p>
<p>ObjectActionDelegates need to be implemented for SWT context menu support for 
each of the popup menus described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ActionFilters</b></p>
<p><b>IActionFilter</b> is an adapter which performs filtering on the actions 
which appear in the context menu. The visibility of each action is controlled by 
filtering only those actions that are using a specific object class and optional 
name filter attributes that are key/value pairs. This prevents irrelevant or 
invalid actions from showing up in the context menu. </p>
<p>The following filters need to be implemented for SWT context menu support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>null layout support for Show/Hide grid</li>
  <li>GridLayout support for Show/Hide grid</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
