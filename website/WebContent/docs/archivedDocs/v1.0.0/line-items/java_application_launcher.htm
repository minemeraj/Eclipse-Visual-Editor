<h2><font face="Times New Roman">Java Application Launcher </font></h2>
<p>Currently the Visual Editor provides the capability to launch a visual 
application using the VE's own Java application launcher by selecting the class 
from the navigator and selecting the menu item <b>Run--&gt;Run As--&gt;Java Bean</b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/java_a3.gif" width="460" height="179"></p>
<p>This allows the user to customize various optional parameters, the Swing Look 
&amp; Feel, and even a different JRE if not the default. This is very specific to 
AWT/Swing applications in that the class is hosted within a JFrame (Swing) or 
Frame (AWT) class.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This needs to modified such that it will support both SWT and AWT/Swing 
  applications. </li>
  <li>The launcher needs a way of determining if the selected visual application 
  is an SWT or AWT/Swing application.</li>
  <li>SWT applications need to be handled in the following manner when launched 
  with the VE Java Launcher:<ul>
    <li>A Visual class that extends Composite should be hosted within temporary 
    Shell and the temporary Shell called from within a main method. Perhaps 
    provide main method code generation if one doesn't exist.</li>
    <li>A Visual class that extends Object and has a main method will be 
    launched as is.</li>
    <li>A Visual class that extends Object and doesn't have a main method will 
    be have a main method generated.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When the launcher wizard is displayed, the <b>Applet Parameters</b> tab 
  and page, and the Swing Look &amp; Feel parameters should not be shown.</li>
</ul>
