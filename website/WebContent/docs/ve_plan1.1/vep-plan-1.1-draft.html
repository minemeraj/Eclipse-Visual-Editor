<h1>Eclipse Tools -- Visual Editor Project (VEP)<br>
</h1>







<h1>
 DRAFT 1.1 Plan</h1>










Last revised November 3, 2004<br>







<br>







<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the </i><a href="mailto:ve-dev@eclipse.org">ve-dev@eclipse.org</a><i> developer mailing list.</i>

<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release
of the Eclipse Visual Editor Project after version 1.0, designated release version 1.1.
</p>







<ul>








  <li><a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">Target operating environments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility with previous releases</a></li>
</ul>








<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, plans are posted in an embryonic form and then revised from time to
time throughout the release cycle.
</p>







<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;
</p>







<p>The
remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the projects under
the Eclipse Tools/Visual Editor Project subproject. Each plan item covers a
feature or API that is to be added, or some aspect that is to be
improved. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a
concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a
suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work
item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.
</p>










<p>Not
all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is
localized
to a single subsystem; others may involve coordinated changes across
several
projects within the same top-level project; and others may involve
coordination with other top-level projects. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing that others, the plan items
appear in
no particular order.
</p>







<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature work.
</p>







<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>








<p>The release deliverables are:
</p>







<ul>








  <li>Source code release for Eclipse Visual Editor, available as versions tagged
    "R1_1_0" in the eclipse.org <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS
    repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Visual Editor Project runtime binary distributions (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Visual Editor Project runtime binary features on eclipse.org update site
    (install via Eclipse update manager).</li>
</ul>








<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>




<p>Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals exist to facilitate
coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones are:</p>





<ul><li>Friday Feb. 18, 2005&nbsp; - Milestone 1 (1.1 M1) - stable build</li><li>Friday Apr. 1, 2005 - Milestone 2 (1.1 M2) - stable build</li><li>Friday May 13, 2005 - Milestone 3 (1.1 M3) - stable build<br>
  </li>

</ul>





<p>The 1.1 release is targeted for 2Q2005. All release deliverables will be
available for download as soon as the release has been tested and validated in
the target operating configurations listed below.</p>




<h2><a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>








<p>In order to remain current, each release of an Eclipse project targets reasonably current
versions of underlying operating environments and other Eclipse projects on
which it depends.&nbsp;</p>








<p>Most of Eclipse is "pure" Java™ code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is on the
Eclipse Platform, and on the Java 2 Platform that runs it.</p>








<p>The Visual Editor Project version 1.1 release depends on the following:</p>








<ul>








  <li>Java 2 Platform, version 1.4.2<br>
</li>
  <li>Eclipse Platform 3.1</li><li>EMF 3.1</li>
  <li>GEF 3.1</li>
  <li>Windows 2000/XP</li>
  <li>Linux/GTK<br>
  </li>

  
</ul>








<p> The 1.1 release of Visual Editor Project is designed to run on any configuration supporting the above components.</p>








<p>The Eclipse Platform runs in a variety of operating environments. Testing is
focused on a handful of popular
<span class="header">combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these
are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many
operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we
do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered
when running Eclipse on non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any
reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running
Eclipse on a reference platform.</span></p>








<p>Visual Editor Project 1.1 is tested and validated on the following reference platforms:</p>

Project 3.1 plan</a> for a list of reference platforms.</b>]</p>








<h4>Internationalization</h4>








<p> Eclipse is designed as the basis for internationalized products.
The user interface elements provided by the various Eclipse projects, including
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings for Visual Editor Project
are provided
as the default resource bundles. Translations are not provided with this
release. However, the plug-in fragment mechanism provides the means by which translations into any number of
other languages can be incorporated.</p>








<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>








<p>[<b>Compatible evolution is the basis for long-lived software, and the norm
for all Eclipse projects. The following boilerplate spells this out. In
exception circumstances, a project may need to deviate from the norm. If that is
the case, it is critical that this section explains how and why this project
differs from the norm of compatibility.</b>]</p>








<h3>Compatibility of Release 1.1 with 1.0</h3>








<p>Eclipse Visual Editor Project 1.1 will be compatible with Visual Editor Project 1.0.</p>








<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b>
Visual Editor Project 1.0 defines all API contracts as internal
APIs.&nbsp; A major plan item for Visual Editor Project 1.1 will be
to begin defining what is and is not API (see below).</p>








<p><b>Source and Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b>&nbsp;
Because Visual Editor Project 1.0 did not define any public API, by
definition, no binary compatibility is enabled.&nbsp; However, we
will work with all add-in providers to help them migrate their code to
the new officially-supported APIs.<br>
</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Editor Layout Compatibility:</span>&nbsp;
Eclipse Visual Editor Project 1.1 will be able to read and operate on
all Java source code that is created using Visual Editor Project 1.0.<br>

</p>



<b>Workspace Compatibility:</b>
Eclipse Visual Editor Project 1.1 will be upwards
workspace-compatible with Visual Editor Project 1.0
unless noted. This means that
workspaces and projects created by an Eclipse with Visual Editor Project 1.0 installed can be successfully opened
by an Eclipse with Visual Editor Project 1.1 installed. This
includes both hidden
metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as
metadata
files found within a workspace project, which may
propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories.
User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is
upgraded.
Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. Metadata files
created (or overwritten)
by the newer version will generally be unusable with older versions.




<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins.
</p>







<h2>Themes</h2>



The changes under consideration for the next release of Eclipse Visual Editor Project
address a single major theme:




<ul>








  <li><b>Platform Maturity </b>-
With VEP 1.0, we have delivered a platform that is functional on
Linux/GTK and is very usable on Windows.&nbsp; Further, we have
implemented all of the minimum features required to support both the
Swing and SWT widget toolkits, in standalone and in Eclipse Rich Client
Platform applications.<br>
    <br>
VEP 1.1 will focus on improving, maturing, and solidifying our existing support.<br>
</li>
</ul>








<p>Each theme has a number of items; the relevant theme is identified for each committed, proposed, and deferred
plan items.</p>



<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
</p>







<ul>








  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
</ul>








<h2><a name="project1">Eclipse Visual Editor project</a></h2>








<p>The Eclipse Visual Editor
Project intends to become the GUI editor for any language that can be
used inside Eclipse.&nbsp; Plan
items reflect new features of the Visual Editor Project, or areas where
existing
features will be significantly reworked.</p>








<h4>Committed Items</h4>








<blockquote>
  <p><b>Platform Performance.</b>&nbsp;
Put simply, VEP can be faster.&nbsp; We intend to do whatever
rewriting and refactoring is necessary in order to make the experience
of using VEP as pleasant and usable as possible from a performance
perspective.&nbsp; This includes opening a new visual editor after the
VEP plugin has already been activated and updating the visual design
surface whenever the programmer changes the source code.&nbsp; (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77674">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77674</a>) </p>
  <p><b>API documentation.</b>&nbsp;
Currently, all Visual Editor Project APIs are internal APIs.&nbsp;
We will begin the process of solidifying and documenting
APIs.&nbsp; This work depends on the Platform Performance work,
because some of the performance optimizations we consider may have the
effect of breaking our current (internal) APIs. (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77677">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77677</a>)</p>
</blockquote>








<h4>Proposed Items</h4>








<blockquote ="">
  <p><b>Evolve
Rich Client Platform Support.</b>&nbsp; Currently,
Eclipse's Rich Client Platform is supported by VEP's ability to edit an
arbitrary Composite.&nbsp; It would be nicer to have more complete
integration.&nbsp; For example, it would be nice to be able to create an Eclipse View or Editor from VEP's File/New wizard. (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77679">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77679</a>)<br>
</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Object factory support / JFace support.&nbsp; </span>JFace has taken the lead by creating SWT layouts using a
      <br>

  </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
public Composite createPartControl(Composite parent);
      <br>
  </div>



      <br>


factory method pattern.&nbsp; Essential Data and other frameworks have copied 
this good idea and used it in many places.&nbsp; We need to support this.&nbsp; (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77682">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77682</a>)<br>

  <p>
  </p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support Eclipse's FormLayout and JGoodies FormLayout layout managers.</span>&nbsp;
One of the first things we would like to document is how to extend VEP
to support custom layout managers.&nbsp; Subject to time
constraints, we will implement one or both of these layout managers in
VEP and document how we did it to assist with future layout manager
integration efforts.<br>
  <br>
It is extremely likely that the implementation of both layout managers
will be contingent on receiving adequate volunteer assistance from the Visual
Editor Project open-source development community.&nbsp; (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77683">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77683</a>)<br>
  </p>

</blockquote>








<h4>Deferred Items</h4>








<blockquote>
  <p>The
following items have been proposed on the Visual Editor Project
newsgroup.&nbsp; They are listed here so that we do not lose them
(and are not listed in any particular order).&nbsp; Note that
although all of these items are listed as deferred, if the Visual
Editor Project team receives enough help from the community, these
items can be added to the "committed items" or "completed items" list.<br>
</p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse Forms toolkit support.&nbsp; </span>Some RCP projects are using the Eclipse Forms toolkit.<br>
  <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
More
coding pattern support.</span> So you can bring your JBuilder project,
NetBeans project, etc., into VE. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Palette customization.</span>&nbsp; The ablility to add, move and delete items/categories from the palette.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cut/Copy/paste</span> controls on the design surface.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Java 1.4 and 1.5 support.</span>&nbsp; JSpinner, SpringLayout, etc.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support Custom Swing models.</span>&nbsp; Table models, etc.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">BeanInfo editor.</span>&nbsp; Writing custom BeanInfo can be tedious.&nbsp; This is an opportunity for automation.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Support for custom Swing Action creation.</span>&nbsp; Swing objects that generate actions should be able to generate custom actions.
