<P>The ContainerPolicy and it subclasses and ILayoutPolicyHelper have been changed. The basic change is that there is now the capability of dropping one class and having a different class be the actual class dropped. </P>

<P>To allow this we now have the concept of changing the object
being dropped depending on the parent.</P>
<P>This may sound weird, but take JFace TreeViewer as an example. What
we want is to take a TreeViewer from the palette and drop it on a
Composite. What we want to happen then is a TreeViewer is created, and
then the &quot;tree&quot; property of the TreeViewer is added as the
child of the Composite, and not the TreeViewer itself. Or take the case
of dropping the TreeViewer onto a Tree. In this case we want a
TreeViewer created that points to the Tree, but there is no child added
to the Tree itself. The current structure doesn't permit this. The
object in the loaded cursor is what must be dropped. So to do this in
the current way is we would need to drop the TreeViewer onto the
freeform, and then set the Tree from it into the Composite. This is
cumbersome.</P>
<P>ContainerPolicy has been changed such that on adds and creates it will get the IContainmentHandler for the object that is being dropped, and it will ask it to contribute to the drop. The IContainmentHandler has the options of:<BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Doing Nothing</B>: In this case the ContainerPolicy will take the object being dropped, treat it as a normal child as in the past and add it to the parent if it is valid.</LI>
	<LI><B>Return a different child</B>: In this case the ContainerPolicy will take the different child and treat it as the object being dropped instead and do the normal processing with the new child instead.</LI>
	<LI><B>Do everything</B>: In this case it returns no child so the ContainerPolicy will treat it as if no child was being added. The handler would of created all of the necessary commands to do what it wanted to do.</LI>
	<LI><B>Combination of the above</B>: It can do any combination of the above, such as return the same child, but create some commands that should also be executed, return a different child but create some commands that should be executed, return no child but create some commands that should also be executed.</LI>
	<LI><B>Stop the drop</B>: One final option is that the handler can tell the ContainerPolicy that it should not allow any drops at all. For example this could be used to indicate that the child does not accept the parent as a parent. An example of this would be SWT Shell as the child. Shell can't be a child of any Composite, but Shell subclasses Control, so the Composite would think that Shell is valid child. So the Shell handler would indicate that it can't be dropped on a Composite.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The IContainmentHandler is an instance of an IModelAdapter. The override file for a class would indicate what IModelAdapter to use for a class. The ContainerPolicy gets the IContainmentHandler for the class of the object being dropped. This is how the override file specifies the IModelAdapter:<BR>

the method, will not have an IContainmentHandler called against it. It is 
assumed that the child is fine and can be added. (The only check that will be 
done is if the child is a valid type for parent). Implementers must handle if 
they changed the child for a non-creation required, they must decide if the

<P>Now here are the major changes for migration. There is no migration utility. Code will need to be changed. It is not compatible with older subclasses.</P>
<H1>org.eclipse.ve.internal.cde.core.ContainerPolicy</H1>
<P>The getAddCommand and the getCreateCommand now return a ContainerPolicy.Result instance instead of a command. The reason for this is because some callers may need to know the actual children that were dropped, not just the command that will be used to perform the drop. The Result class has an accessor to get both the command to use and the list of real children added or created.</P>
<H1>org.eclipse.ve.internal.cde.emf.AbstractEMFContainerPolicy</H1>
<P>The getAddCommand and getCreateCommand have been made final. The reason for this is to make sure that the processing the IContainmentHandler is performed. Sometimes these methods had been overridden and tried to do something different. If they had not been made final then it would be very easy to have the IContainmentHandler processing skipped. These methods will do the IContainmentHandler processing and then call delegate methods with the revised true list of children. Subclasses need to implement the appropriate delegate methods instead of these methods. See the javadoc for the <code>getCreateCommand(List children, Object positionBeforeChild, CommandBuilder cbldr)</code> and the <code>getAddCommand(List children, Object positionBeforeChild, CommandBuilder cbldr)</code> for how overrides should be done.</P>
<H1>org.eclipse.ve.internal.java.visual.VisualContainerPolicy</H1>
<P>The getAddCommand and getCreateCommand that took children and constraints have been made final and return a VisualContainerPolicy.CorelatedResult instance instead of a command. The reason for this is to make sure that the processing the IContainmentHandler is performed. Sometimes these methods had been overridden and tried to do something different. If they had not been made final then it would be very easy to have the IContainmentHandler processing skipped. These methods will do the IContainmentHandler processing and then call delegate methods with the revised true list of children. Subclasses need to implement the appropriate delegate methods instead of these methods. The results has an accessor to get the children acutally dropped, and also the list of constraints that are associated with each child in the children list. The constraints themselves will not actually be changed, just some may of been removed from the list if the cooresponding child by index was removed from the original children list.</P>
<P>See the javadoc and implementation of VisualContainerPolicy getAddCommand and getCreateCommand to see what is changed and how subclasses need to be changed.</P>
<H1>org.eclipse.ve.internal.java.visual.ILayoutPolicyHelper</H1>
<P>The getAddCommand and getCreateCommand have been changed to return a VisualContainerPolicy.CorelatedResult instead of a command. This go in hand with the same changes made to the VisualContainerPolicy.</P>
<P>Many other classes have been changed too, but they were changed just to match the new methods and the new Result class. To see a use of the Result class look at org.eclipse.ve.internal.jfc.core.NullLayoutPolicyHelper.getAddCommand.</P>

	src="http://eclipse.org/articles/images/tag_1.gif"> Here we are building up the list of constraints to use for the components. We use a new inner class called NullConstraintWrapper. This guy wrappers the constraintComponent, which is required by the awt VisualContainerPolicy, and the separate NullConstraint, which is the bounds of the component being added. The null constraint wrapper returns the constraintComponent for the constraint inside the VisualContainerPolicy.</P>

This method, getChangeConstraint, could of been called by itself, in which case the list of constraints would of all been null constraints. That is why the instanceof check is performed.</P>
