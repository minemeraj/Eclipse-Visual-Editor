/**
 * @author richkulp
 * 
 * This is for AWT Choice component. It is actually a Linux bug. Sun Bug Parade #188992 has been opened to fix it. The problem is that on Linux you
 * can't do a printAll of a choice that has no entries. You get a null pointer exception. So to get around it we will automatically add in one empty
 * string so that it won't be empty. Since at the moment we don't respond to add(String) as properties anyway, the live object wouldn't see any add's
 * in the code. So an empty string will be just fine.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note: </b>This was marked as "Fixed" for 1.4.1, but the fix was "Not reproducable". So we don't know if it is really fixed, so we'll just keep
 * this permanently.
