<h1 class="topictitle1">Java bean exceptions</h1>
<div><p>During normal development, exceptions are sometimes thrown by the
Java beans. The visual editor displays icons and visual markers to indicate
exceptions.</p>
<p> For example, when a visual class is instantiated or when property values
are applied, a visual class might throw an exception. If an exception is thrown
when a property value is applied, the Java bean is recreated and all of the
other valid properties are applied. A warning sign is shown in the Design
view and the Java beans view to indicate that an exception occurred  <br /><img src="../images/DesignWarningException.gif" alt="exception warning sign" /><br />  <br /><img src="../images/JavaBeansWarningException.gif" alt="exception in Java bean view" /><br /></p>
<p>When you select a component that has a warning, the status line will show
you the property that threw the exception as well as the exception message.
For example, if the button's text property threw a runtime exception the status
bar would be:<br /><img src="../images/StatusWarningException.gif" alt="exception in status bar" /><br /></p>
<p>When the exception is thrown during the application of a property value,
the Java bean is recreated and the property ignored. The warning sign indicates
that the representation of the live Java bean, as shown in the Design view
or the Properties view, is incomplete, as the errant property has not been
applied.</p>
<p>In addition to exceptions thrown when property values are applied, there
may be an exception thrown during instantiation of the Java bean. In this
case it is not possible to partially create the Java bean, as was done for
bad property values, so no live Java bean will be present. To indicate this,
for errors thrown during instantiation of the Java bean, a red x is shown
in the Design view and Java Beans view. You can select the Java bean to see
the exception message in the status line.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/DesignTerminalException.gif" alt="exception in Design view" /> </p>
<p>A "Too complicated" error, represented by a blue circle with an exclamation
point, occurs when the initialization string for a property is too complicated
for the visual editor to understand.</p>
