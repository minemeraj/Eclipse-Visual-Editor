<h1 class="topictitle1">The Java Beans view</h1>
<div><p>This Java Beans view shows a tree view of the components, events,
and listeners used by the Java class.</p>
<p>The Java Beans view of the visual editor for Java shows a tree view of
all the components that are used in the class that you are composing. The
Java Beans view is automatically opened each time the visual editor is launched,
unless you have changed the preferences.<br /><img src="../images/javabeansview.gif" alt="Java Beans view" /><br /> </p>
<p>The selection between the entries in the Java Beans view and the Design
view is synchronized both ways. If you select an item or items in the Design
view, they are also selected in the Java Beans view. In the Java Beans view,
the icon shown for the entry is the same icon used in the palette to represent
the component type.</p>
<p>The label for each component in the Java Beans view is the name of the
instance variable that is used in the Java code for the component. For some
types of components, the label also contains details from the instance itself,
for example the text of a button or label.</p>
<p>In addition to using the Java Beans view to see the structure of the existing
components, you can use the Java Beans view to manipulate your class. By right-clicking
on a component in the Java Beans view, you can access a pop-up menu with available
actions. You can also drag components to reorder and nest them.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>When you subclass a component such as  <tt class="sysout">HelloFrame</tt> that
subclasses  <samp class="codeph">javax.swing.JFrame</samp>, a special part called  <var class="varname">this</var> is
shown on the Design view and the Java Beans view. The <var class="varname">this</var> element
represents the instance of the class itself that is being composed. You cannot
delete the <var class="varname">this</var> element.</div>
