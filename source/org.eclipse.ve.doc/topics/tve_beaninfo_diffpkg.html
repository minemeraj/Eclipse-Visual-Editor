<h1 class="topictitle1">Keeping beans and BeanInfo classes in different packages in the same
project</h1>
<div><p>When you develop classes in the visual editor for Java, you have
the option to keep your .java files and BeanInfo classes in different packages
within the same project.</p>
<div class="section"><p>To accomplish this, you must edit the properties of the Java project
to configure the BeanInfo search path that the visual editor uses. By keeping
them in separate packages, you are separating design-time and run-time classes,
so you can deploy them separately.</p>
<p>For example, a project called
MyProject contains the following packages:</p>
<ul><li><strong>runtimeclasses</strong> - this package includes a class called runtimeclasses.MyJavaBean</li>
<li><strong>beaninfoclasses</strong> - this package contains the BeanInfo class for
MyJavaBean, beaninfoclasses.MyJavaBeanBeanInfo</li>
</ul>
<p>To configure the setup just described:  </p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>In the Java perspective, right-click the project that contains
both packages, and select <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span> from the pop-up
menu.</span></li>
<li><span>Select <span class="uicontrol">BeanInfo Path</span> from the list of properties.</span></li>
<li><span>On the Packages page, make sure the <span class="uicontrol">Enable BeanInfo
Introspection on this Project</span> check box is selected. Otherwise,
no information in the BeanInfo path will be used at any time for the project.</span></li>
<li><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Choose packages</span> button, and select
one or more packages in the same project that contain the BeanInfo classes.</span></li>
<li><strong>Optional: </strong><span>If you want to change the order in which
packages are searched during introspection, click the <span class="uicontrol">Order and
export</span> tab and use the <span class="uicontrol">Up</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Down</span> buttons.
During introspection, the rules for finding a suitable BeanInfo class for
a Java bean are applied to each package in turn. Changing the order of packages
is required only if there are two or more possible BeanInfo classes that may
be candidates for the same Java bean class.</span></li>
<li><span>If you want these packages to be included in the BeanInfo search
path for classes in other Java projects that reference classes in this project
(and therefore include this project in their Java build path), the package
that contains the BeanInfo classes must be exported. Confirm the following
settings:</span><ol type="a"><li><span>On the <span class="uicontrol">Order and export</span> tab of the BeanInfo
properties, make sure that the packages that contain the BeanInfo classes
are selected for export.</span></li>
<li><span>On the <span class="uicontrol">Java Build Path</span> properties page
for the same project, make sure that the packages containing the BeanInfo
classes are not excluded from export there. Excluding them on the Java Build
Path properties overrides your setting on the BeanInfo Path properties
page.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><p>When the introspector is created for the project, it includes all
packages specified in the Packages list in its search path.  </p>
