<h1 class="topictitle1">JSplitPane and its components</h1>
<div><p>The class javax.swing.JSplitPane allows you to have two components with
a split bar between them. At runtime you can select the split bar and move
it, thereby saving space on the screen. The two child components are shown
beneath the JSplitPane on the Java Beans view. When you drop a new component
on the Java Beans view or the Design view, it will become the left component
if there is no existing child. Otherwise, it becomes the right component.
If there is already a left and right component, then a drop is not allowed.</p>
<p>Whether the Visual Editor for Java shows the left and right component as
children depends on the value of its orientation property. If this property
is set to VERTICAL_SPLIT then the bottom and top component are shown instead.</p>
<p>The method generated for each of the split pane children is to set one
of its properties using a set method. For example:</p>
<pre>ivjJSplitPane.setTopComponent(getIvjJButton());</pre>
<p>In addition to setting a component using a set method, it can be added
using a constraint of "top", "bottom" "left" or "right". For example:  </p>
<pre>ivjJSplitPane.addComponent(getIvjJButton(),"top");</pre>
<p>The style with the set method is the one that is generated, although if
the code uses the  <tt class="sysout">add(Component,Object)</tt>  method
with a valid constraint, it will be recognized by the Visual Editor for Java. </p>
<p>When dropping components onto a JSplitPane, if the divider location is
not explicitly set it will change according to the preferred size of the left
or top component. Then it will fill the opposite side with the remaining component
if one is set. For example, if you drop a JPanel into a JSplitPane with no
components, it will be assigned by default to the left side. The divider location
will move to the far left in the split pane because the preferredSize for
a JPanel is very small. If you then drop components onto the JPanel that has
a FlowLayout, the split pane will resize according to the preferred size of
the JPanel, which has now changed because of the preferred sizes of the components
that were added to it.</p>
<p>The Visual Editor for Java will render JLayeredPane indexes in a single
layer. In the case of multilayer / indexes, the Visual Editor for Java may
not show the components in the correct order. </p>
