<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding events to a component</h1>
<div><p>You can add an event to a component in the Design view or Java
Beans view of the visual editor for Java.</p>
<div class="section">To add an event to a component:</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>Right-click the component in the Java Beans view or the Design
view.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>From the pop-up menu, click <span class="uicontrol">Events</span>.</span> The pop-up menu shows the preferred events for the component. Do one
of the following steps:<ul><li>Click one of the preferred events for the component. The event is
added to the component. For example, for a JFrame the preferred events are
windowClosed and windowOpened.</li>
<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Add Events</span> to open the Add Events window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you opened the Add Events window, you are presented with a list
of categorized events to choose from. Select the event that you want to add,
then click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span> <ul><li>The Add Event dialog shows all of the available events for the component
in a tree. The tree shows the event listeners as the first level of entries,
and beneath each listener entry are the possible callbacks the event can raise.<div class="image"><img src="../images/AddEventDialog_01.gif" alt="add event dialog" /></div></li>
<li>You can use the dialog to specify whether you want to create a new listener
or use an existing one. When the dialog opens, it analyzes the existing listeners,
and if it finds one that it believes can be re-used, it marks the listener
with a different icon. For existing listeners that extend an adapter class,
the <img src="../images/icons/anonclass_obj.gif" alt="event present class" /> icon is used, otherwise, the <img src="../images/icons/genlistener_obj.gif" alt="event present" /> is used. Within the listener itself, existing events are shown with
a green arrow <img src="../images/icons/e2mconn_obj.gif" alt="green arrow" />, and available events are shown with an incomplete arrow <img src="../images/icons/unevent_obj.gif" alt="unevent" /></li>
<li>You can specify whether or not you want to use the existing listener or
create a new one. When a new one is created, you can choose whether you
want it to extend the adapter class or just implement the listener interface. If
an option is not applicable, the radio buttons are disabled. For example,
if there is no existing listener, or an existing listener is selected but
the selected event is already used, the <span class="uicontrol">Use existing Listener</span> is
disabled. If there is no available adapter class for a new listener then the <span class="uicontrol">extends:
ADAPTER_CLASS_NAME</span> radio button is disabled.</li>
<li>If you select propertyChange in the Add Event dialog, you have additional
options for adding the callback. A new listener can be created that can be
added to the JavaBean using the method a <samp class="codeph">addPropertyChange(PropertyChangeListener
listener)</samp>. If this occurs then the listener's generic callback method <samp class="codeph">propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent
event)</samp> is used for all property events.  On some JavaBeans (such
as Swing components) the two argument method <samp class="codeph">addPropertyChange(String
propertyName, PropertyChangeListener listener)</samp> is available and selected
by default to use for the new listener.<p><img src="../images/AddEventDialog_02.gif" alt="add event dialog" /> </p>
<p>A listener that is added using the two argument method is
specific to a particular property, so it cannot be reused for another property. A
listener added with a single argument method has an <samp class="codeph">if</samp> statement
that checks the name of the property before processing the logic for each
property callback as shown in the following code:</p>
<div class="p"><pre>javaBean.addPropertyChangeListener(new java.beans.PropertyChangeListener() { 
     public void propertyChange(java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent e) {  
        if ((e.getPropertyName().equals("font"))) {  
            System.out.println("propertyChange(font)");   
       }  
    }  
});</pre>
 </div>
<p>This allows a PropertyChangeListener added with a single
argument method to be used for more than one property ( by having multiple
if{} blocks used ). </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span></span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><p></p>
<p>When you add an event, if there is an existing listener
that can be used, then the callback method is added to it. Otherwise, a new
listener is created. For an existing listener to be used, it must be
an anonymous inner class on the JavaBean that implements the listener interface.
It must have an empty method body for the callback method, or extend the adapter
class. and have no existing method for the event callback being added. 
For a property, an existing PropertyChangeListener will be re-used if it is
added to the JavaBean with the single argument method  <samp class="codeph">addPropertyChange(PropertyChangeListener
listener).</samp> If it does not already have code, processing the property
is added.</p>
<p>If there is no candidate existing listener onto which the
callback method can be added, then a new listener is created.  This will
be an anonymous inner class, and if an adapter class has been defined for
the event then the listener will extend this. Otherwise, it will implement
the listener interface.  After the event is added a stub method is created
with a  //TODO comment.  The stub method is an indicator of the
source code that will be executed when the event occurs, and you should then
change this to perform your required behavior. The //TODO comment is displayed
in the Tasks window, flagging incomplete methods. This is so that you can
locate them later and remove the //TODO comment once the callback logic has
been written.</p>
<p>In the previous example the windowOpened method already
exists.  If this is a listener that extends the adapter, the same listener
will be re-used because it does not already have a windowClosed method . The
method  <samp class="codeph">windowClosed(WindowEvent e)</samp> is added, and the method
stub and //TODO comment added as shown here:</p>
<div class="p"><pre>this.addWindowListener(new java.awt.event.WindowAdapter() {       
        <strong>public void windowClosed(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e) {</strong>  
<strong>         System.out.println("windowClosed()"); // TODO Auto-generated stub windowClosed() </strong> <strong>     
              } </strong>      
        public void windowOpened(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e) {          
             callExistingWindowOpenedLogic();      
            }  
});</pre>
 </div>
<p>In expert mode, events can still be added to the JavaBean
as shown previously, but they can also be added to a listener in the Java
Beans tree.  The Events menu shows all of the event callback methods
on the listener, and any that are already used are disabled.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/AddWindowClosed_02.gif" alt="add window closed" /> </p>
<p>For
a PropertyChangeListener the pop-up menu shows all of the bound properties
on the JavaBean.  If any are already used by the PropertyChangeListener
then they are disabled.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/PropertyChangeListener_01.gif" alt="property change listener" /> </p>
<p>A listener added with a single argument method has an if statement
that checks the name of the property before processing the logic for each
property callback as shown in the following code:</p>
<div class="p"><pre>javaBean.addPropertyChangeListener(new java.beans.PropertyChangeListener() {  
    public void propertyChange(java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent e) {                        
             if ((e.getPropertyName().equals("font"))) {              
                   System.out.println("propertyChange(font)");         
             }     
          }  
    });</pre>
 </div>
<p>This allows a PropertyChangeListener added with
a single argument method to be used for more than one property ( by having
multiple if{} blocks used ), and when the second and subsequent property callback
is added a new if{} blocks are added.</p>
<p>If the propertyChangeListener
is added to the JavaBean using the two argument method  <samp class="codeph">addPropertyChangeListener(String
propertyName, PropertyChangeListener listener)</samp> then it is specific
to a particular property so cannot be re-used for another property. In this
case all of the Events cascade menu children are disabled.</p>
