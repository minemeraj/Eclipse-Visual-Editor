<h1 class="topictitle1">Aligning components using X/Y alignment</h1>
<div><p>When you set the layout property for a component to null, you can
use the Customize Layout window to align components based on their boundaries.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><p>With layout set to null, each component is independently placed
and sized on the user interface based on its bounds. To avoid the tedious
and error-prone task of individually updating each component's bounds, you
can use the visual editor to align and adjust the sizes and placement of components
based on relationships.</p>
<div class="p">When layout is set to null, the Customize Layout
window has a number of actions that work on a group of components. You can:<ul><li>Align components based on edges</li>
<li>Align components based on center points</li>
<li>Make components the same width and height</li>
<li>Distribute components evenly, both vertically and horizontally, across
a given space</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To align, resize, and distribute components in null layout:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Design view or Java Beans view, select two or more components
that you want to align or adjust in relation to each other. You can use the
marquee selection tool or hold the Ctrl key to select multiple components. </span> The last component that you select is the control component, or
anchor. The anchor component is indicated by black resize handles, while the
other selected components have white handles.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Do one of the following steps to open the Customize Layout window: </span><ul><li>Right-click and select <span class="uicontrol">Customize Layout</span> from
the pop-up menu.</li>
<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Customize Layout</span> <span><img src="../images/aligndialog_obj.gif" alt="show alignment window icon" /></span> in the toolbar.</li>
</ul>
 <br /><img src="../images/customizeLayout_null.gif" alt="Customize Layout window for null layout" /><br /></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To align the components with each other, use the following buttons:</span><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Align left</span> - aligns the components with the
left edge of the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align center</span> - aligns the components with the
center of the anchor component along a vertical plane.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align right</span> - aligns the components with the
right edge of the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align top</span> - aligns the components with the
top edge of the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align middle</span> - aligns the components with the
middle of the anchor component along a horizontal plane.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align bottom</span> - aligns the components with the
bottom edge of the anchor component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To adjust the size of the selected components, use the following
buttons:</span><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Match width</span> - makes the components the same
width as the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Match height</span> - makes the components the same
height as the anchor component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To distribute the spacing of the components, first do one of the
following to specify the bounds of the distribution area:</span><ul><li>Click nothing to use the container as the distribution area (which
is the default behavior), or click <span class="uicontrol">Hide distribute box</span> if
the box is already showing.</li>
<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Show distribute box</span> and
drag the handles of the box to create the required size for your distribution.</li>
</ul>
 Then, use one of the following buttons to distribute the components:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Distribute horizontally</span> - makes the components
the same width as the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Distribute vertically</span> - makes the components
the same height as the anchor component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>For example, you can select three JButton components and specify
that they should be the same width and aligned with each other on the left
bound. The last selected JButton component is used as the anchor, or control,
for the other two buttons. The <span class="uicontrol">Align left</span> action aligns
the JButton components with the left edge of the last selected JButton component,
and the <span class="uicontrol">Match width</span> action makes the selected JButton
components the same width as the control JButton component.</p>
<p>The alignment
buttons on the Customize Layout window are only enabled if the following conditions
are true:</p>
<ul><li>Two or more components are selected, and the parent container is not using
a layout manager (layout is set to null).</li>
<li>The components have no parent and have been placed on the Design view
directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to aligning components and matching width and height,
you can distribute components. When components are distributed, their positions
are changed so that they are evenly spaced within a bounding box defined by
their parent container. For example, before clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Distribute
vertical</span> button  <img src="../images/distributevert_obj.gif" alt="distribute vertical button" />, three buttons have uneven spacing, as
shown in the following image:</p>
<p><br /><img src="../images/Align_01.gif" alt="beans as placed on Design view" /><br /></p>
<p> After clicking <span class="uicontrol">Distribute vertical</span>,
the components are spaced evenly, as shown in the following image:</p>
<p><br /><img src="../images/Align_02.gif" alt="beans distributed vertically" /><br /></p>
<p>Notice
that the three buttons are distributed within the height of the parent (the
frame's top and bottom edge).</p>
<p>For more control over the area used for
the distribution, you can enable the distribution box by clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Show
distribute box</span> <img src="../images/distributebox_obj.gif" alt="distribute box" /> button.
When you click this button, a box is drawn around the area of all the selected
components. You can move and resize this box using its handles. When you use
a distribution box and the box is active, the distribution box defines the
area that is used to reposition the controls. Without a distribution box,
the parent container defines the area used for distribution. The following
image shows a distribution box:</p>
<p><br /><img src="../images/Align_03.gif" alt="beans with distribution box" /><br /></p>
<p>You can move and
resize the distribution box, as the following image shows:</p>
<p><br /><img src="../images/Align_04.gif" alt="beans in resized distribution box" /><br /></p>
<p>If you do
a vertical distribution while using the distribution box, the distribution
takes place within the boundaries of the box, rather than the parent container,
as is shown in the following image:</p>
<p><br /><img src="../images/Align_05.gif" alt="beans distributed vertically within box" /><br /></p>
