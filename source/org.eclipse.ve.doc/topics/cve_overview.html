<h1 class="topictitle1">About the visual editor for Java</h1>
<div><p>The visual editor for Java is a code-centric Java editor that helps
you design applications that have a graphical user interface (GUI). The visual
editor is based on the JavaBeans component model and supports visual construction
using the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), the Abstract Window
Toolkit (AWT), or Swing.</p>
<p>The visual editor is designed to work with .java source files, letting
you edit the source and the design simultaneously. The visual editor does
not have its own perspective. If you use the visual editor in the Java perspective,
the visual editor for Java uses any customization that you have made to the
position of the Tasks view, the Console view and the Outline view.</p>
<p>You can use the visual editor for Java to create a class using visual components,
or Java beans, from a design palette. This class can be an executable application
(a class with a main method) or it can be a Java bean that you intend to include
in another class. To be used as a Java bean by the visual editor for Java
there is no interface that must be implemented and the only requirement is
that the editor knows how to instantiate the class. For most purposes this
means that the class should be public and have a public null constructor.
The null constructor can be explicit or implicit, although there are a few
exceptions that the visual editor for Java recognizes, such as java.awt.Dialog
subclasses. They are instantiated using the constructor that takes an argument
of java.awt.Frame. The visual editor adds an explicit constructor that calls
the initialize method, which is used to set up the initial state of the Java
bean.</p>
<p>The workbench has a number of editors that can be used to edit a .java
source file. The Java Editor lets you write your source manually, while the
visual editor for Java combines a Source view with a Design view where you
can lay out and preview visual components.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/cve_designsource.html">The visual editor Design and Source views</a></b><br />
The visual editor for Java editor is divided into two windows: the Design view previews the Java beans in a graphical representation, and the Source view shows the associated Java code.</div>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/cve_palette.html">The visual editor design palette</a></b><br />
The visual editor for Java includes a palette of components and other selection tools for you to use in the Design view.</div>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/cve_propertiesview.html">The visual editor Properties view</a></b><br />
The Properties view shows the properties for the selected Java bean that is selected in either the Design view or the Java Beans view.</div>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/cve_javabeansview.html">The Java Beans view</a></b><br />
This Java Beans view shows a tree view of the components, events, and listeners used by the Java class.</div>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/cve_codegen.html">Source code generation in the visual editor</a></b><br />
As you make changes to a visual class in the Design view, the Java source is updated. Likewise, as you edit the Java source, the graphical design view is updated to reflect the code changes.</div>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/cve_javabeans.html">How it works: the visual editor and Java Beans</a></b><br />
A model of live Java beans is maintained by the visual editor, allowing you to see the graphical representation of Java beans that are java.awt.Component subclasses, and to display the values in the Properties view for unset properties.</div>
<div class="ulchildlink"><b><a href="../topics/tve_prefs.html">Setting visual editor preferences</a></b><br />
You can set preferences that affect the appearance of the visual editor, the way the visual editor generates and parses Java code, and other preferences.</div>
