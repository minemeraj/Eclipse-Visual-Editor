/**
 * AWT Container policy for handling children in an AWT container.
 * This is special in that none of the add/create commands
 * come through the standard methods. This is because they are
 * special in Containers. The children are ConstraintComponents but
 * the model object of the child editpart is awt.Component. So the
 * requests wouldn't have the ConstraintComponent in them.
 * So the layout and tree editpolicies will cast directly to
 * ContainerEditPolicy and use the special methods listed here.
 *
 * The delete, move, and orphan commands can come through the
 * standard way because no pre-processing is needed in the
 * layout/tree policies to strip out the components and constraints.
