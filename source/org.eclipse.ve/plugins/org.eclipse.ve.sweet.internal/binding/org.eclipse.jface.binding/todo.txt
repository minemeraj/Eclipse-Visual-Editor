  (+) work on this can start right away, or has started already.
  (-) Requires new or changed API

+ Add support for more SWT widgets
  + (Joe) Label

+ Write tests for the updatables on the model side.
+ Write tests for the binding code.
+ (Joe) Write tests for the updatables on the widget side.
+ (Joe) Build showcase example.
+ (Boris) Support other update policies for SWT widgets (e.g. focus lost)
+ Write generic updatables for Java bean model objects.
+ Write examples with validation.
+ Build end-to-end example.
+ Write updatables for POJOs.
- Support virtual tables.
- Maybe expose something like EMFDerivedUpdatableValue in a more generic way?
- Support other cell editors, not just TextCellEditor.
- (Boris) How are factories registered, and how does the look-up work?
- Are factories for IUpdatables, IConverters, IValidators all treated in the same way?
- How could multi-value validation work?
- Once the API for tables is more stable, derive API for lists
- (Boris) Allow binding contexts to be nested. Reasons for this are:
  - Factories are registered for a longer time than the life of a concrete binding context.
  - Validation on sub-parts
  - Allow overriding of factories in subcontexts.
