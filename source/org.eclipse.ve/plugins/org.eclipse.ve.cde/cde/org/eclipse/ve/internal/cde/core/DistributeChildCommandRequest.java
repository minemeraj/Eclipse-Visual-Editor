 * Request for Distribute on a a child of this component.
 * Typically this has been rerouted to this parent
 * by the Primary Drag Role Edit Policy,
 * since that policy typically handles move/size requests.
 *
 * Note: Processors of this request must return a
 * command. If no command is returned, this is interpreted
 * as distribute not permitted. So if no change in position
 * was performed, but distribute was permitted, then return
 * NoOpCommand.INSTANCE so that it is known the distribute
 * was allowed. In this manner if no one processes the
 * request then it is assumed it is not distributable (such as if the
 * child is on a Flow Layout, there distribute doesn't make sense).
