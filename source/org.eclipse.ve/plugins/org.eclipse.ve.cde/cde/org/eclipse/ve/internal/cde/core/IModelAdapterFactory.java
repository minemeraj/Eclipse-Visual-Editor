/**
 * Interface for the model related objects factory.
 * There are different objects required by the CDE
 * relating to the model, and not specifically any viewer.
 * This factory return those various adapters. It is used
 * because model objects are usually not IAdaptable, and
 * even if they are, they wouldn't be returning the CDE
 * specific adapters since they aren't needed for the model
 * itself, only the running within the CDE.
 *
 * The model factory, if being used for the current domain,
 * will be stored in the EditDomain using the
 * key MODEL_FACTORY_KEY defined here.
 *
 * A model factory does not need to be used, the customization
 * of CDE that the developer is creating determines if they wish
 * to use it or not.
 *
 * There is a static method on CDEUtilities to retrieve the model factory.

	 *   IConstraintHandler - used when dropping a child to determine if it is resizeable or not.
	 *   IContainmentHandler - used when dropping a child to determine if the parent is viable.

	 * Developers may add there own adapters too.
	 * Adapters should be lightweight because they are created and released frequently.
	 * They shouldn't hold onto data other than the model.
