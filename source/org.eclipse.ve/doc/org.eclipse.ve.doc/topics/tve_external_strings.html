<h1 class="topictitle1">Externalizing text strings with the visual editor</h1>
<div><p>If you are designing a Java application that will be deployed for
use in different locales, any text that is visible to the user needs to be
translated.</p>
<div class="section"><p>Rather than translating the string in the Java source file and
having to create a new executable for each language, Java lets you use resource
bundles to redirect the string through a properties file. For more information
about externalizing strings, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-206.htm">Externalizing strings</a>.</p>
<p>The visual editor for Java
supports displaying the externalized strings. They will show up normally with
the actual values stored in the resource file. </p>
<p>However,
if you change a text property of a component in the visual editor after you
already externalized the string, the text property will overwrite the externalization,
not change the resource file. To reflect changes to the resource file, the
visual editor must be closed and reopened. Be careful when you choose strings
to externalize. By default, all strings are externalized, even strings which
are not displayed on the GUI, for example, font names.</p>
<p>Before externalizing
the string, the string will be presented in the source as a literal. For example:</p>
<pre>ivjJFrame.setTitle("Hello World");</pre>
<p>After using the Externalize Strings wizard, the string will
be retrieved from a static lookup in a file that retrieves the value from
a resource bundle.</p>
<pre>ivjJFrame.setTitle(Messages.getString("Hello_World_1"));
//$NON-NLS-1$</pre>
<p>The string that is the argument to the setTitle method call
is externalized, but the string that represents the bundle key is not because
it is not a user visible string. To indicate that this string is not a user
visible string so the Externalize Strings wizard does not attempt to retrieve
this from a bundle, the comment <samp class="codeph">//$NON-NLS-1$</samp> is appended
to the statement with the <samp class="codeph">1</samp>, indicating that it is referring
to the first string occurrence on the line.  </p>
