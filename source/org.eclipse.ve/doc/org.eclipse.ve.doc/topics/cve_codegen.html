<h1 class="topictitle1">Source code generation in the visual editor</h1>
<div><p>As you make changes to a visual class in the Design view, the Java
source is updated. Likewise, as you edit the Java source, the graphical design
view is updated to reflect the code changes.</p>
<p>The visual editor for Java is a source centric editor that reads and writes
the <span class="filepath">.java</span> source file. The round-trip updates between
the Design view and the Source view are incremental.</p>
<p>When the visual editor for Java is closed, the only file that is persisted
in the workbench is the <span class="filepath">.java</span> file. Because there are
no additional files that store metadata, you can make changes to the file
in another editor, and these changes will be reflected in the visual editor
when it is next opened. When the visual editor for Java is opened to determine
the initial state of the Java beans, the file is parsed and analyzed for certain
patterns. These are used to create a model of the Java beans and their initial
property settings and any relationships between them. You can make modifications
to the source and see these reflected in the Java bean's model as long as
the source still adheres to the recognized patterns.</p>
