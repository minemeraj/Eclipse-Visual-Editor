<h1 class="topictitle1">Code synchronization</h1>
<div><p>As you use the Visual Editor there are two internal models that are maintained.
The first of these is a representation of the Java beans that is used by the
Java Beans view, the Properties view, and the Design view. The second model
is the source that represents the code that, when compiled and executed, will
re-create the Java beans in a runtime VM. As you make changes to either model
the Visual Editor will maintain the other model for you by performing synchronization.
The status of the synchronization of the two models can be seen on the right
hand side of the status bar as shown below</p>
<p> <img src="../images/CodeInSync.gif" alt="code in sync" /> </p>
<p>There is a performance overhead associated with synchronizing the two models,
so the processes to do this are run in background threads on a delay timer.
If changes are made to a model, by either manipulating the Java beans in a
view or by editing the source, the other model needs to be updated or it will
no longer be synchronized. To show that the models are not synchronized, the
label changes from  <b>In Sync</b> to  <b>Out of Sync</b>.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/CodeOutOfSync.gif" alt="code out of sync" /> </p>
<p>After a period of inactivity, for example when you have paused typing code
in the editor, synchronization will occur. While synchronization is taking
place the arrows will show the direction the update is occurring. For example,
the up arrow represents changes from the source to the Java beans model, and
the down arrow vice versa.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/CodeSyncUp.gif" alt="code sync update" /> </p>
<p>If synchronization takes place too frequently and is degrading performance,
the time that the synchronizer waits can be altered using the  <b>Window &gt;
Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Visual Editor</b>. You can change the delay time used
to make updates from the Java beans model to the source, from its initial
value of 500 milliseconds. This is how long the Visual Editor waits after
you have dropped or moved a Java bean in the canvas before updating the source
code. The delay time that the Visual Editor waits before making updates from
the source code to the Java beans model is initially set to be larger by a
factor of 2. So, it will be 2 * 500 = 1000 milliseconds. If you are typing
in the source code, and the synchronizer is starting too soon and you wish
to increase this number, you can increase the factor to a new value. For example,
4 * 500 = 2000. With the value set as 2000, the Visual Editor will wait for
2 seconds until after you have finished modifying the source before updating
the Java beans. If you wish to make a number of large changes to the source
without incurring the overhead of having the synchronizer running, you can
disable synchronization by pressing the pause button between the two arrows.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/CodeSyncPause.gif" alt="code sync paused" /> </p>
<p>While the synchronizer is paused, you can make changes to the source without
any overhead of parsing source, but you can no longer make changes to the
Java beans model. All edits made using the Design view, the Java Beans view,
or the Properties view will not be applied. When you have finished updating
the source, you can resume the synchronizer by pressing the button between
the two arrows. This displays a 'resume' arrow while synchronization is paused.</p>
<p>While the source code is being parsed and analyzed, the synchronizer may
determine that the source contains errors. Rather than trying to update the
Java beans model, it will wait for the errors to be corrected. If this occurs,
the button will be pressed automatically and the graphic will be changed to
a red X.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/CodeSyncError.gif" alt="code sync error" /> </p>
<p>Once the errors have been fixed in the source and it becomes well formed
enough for the parser to continue, the synchronizer will automatically refresh
the Java beans model and continue.</p>
<p>In addition to synchronization between the Java beans model and the source
code, there is also a Java VM that is used to execute the live Java bean instances.
This is synchronously maintained whenever the Java beans model is changed,
and is used by the Properties view and the graphical representation of components
in the Design view. More information on the live Java bean instances and how
to debug them can be found in the section  <a href="tjbeaninved.html">Java
beans exceptions</a>.</p>
