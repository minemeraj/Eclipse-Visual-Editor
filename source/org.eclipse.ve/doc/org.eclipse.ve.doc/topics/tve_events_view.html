<h1 class="topictitle1">Viewing events for a component</h1>
<div><p>The Java Beans view shows all of the events set on the components
in your visual class.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><p>Events can be seen using the <a href="coverview.html">Java
Beans view</a>. This is a tree view that shows the class being edited and
its Java beans, and container classes with their components displayed as children.</p>
<p>In
addition to showing JavaBeans and their container/component relationship,
the Java Beans view has three modes to show events:</p>
<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">No Events</span></li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span></li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To view the events on a component:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>On the Java Beans view toolbar, select the drop-down menu (arrow
button).</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select one of the following:</span><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span></li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span></li>
</ul>
 <p>When <span class="uicontrol">Show Events</span> is selected, the events used
by each component are shown as children in the tree. For an event to be used
by a component, there must be a registered listener, and the callback method
must have some code within it. The list of recognized source code patterns
used by the visual editor are described in the source code patterns for events
section. The Java Beans view below shows the events, where the JFrame has
a windowOpened event, and the button has an actionPerformedEvent. The button
also has a PropertyChangeListener for its enabled properties, and this is
shown with a blue arrow instead of green. <br /><img src="../images/BasicEventsChildren.gif" alt="Basic Events" /><br /></p>
<p>Each event is made up of the
source component (the JFrame or JButton in the example being used), a class
that implements the listener interface that is added to the source using addXXXListener(XXXListener),
and some code within the body of the callback method. In the <span class="uicontrol">Show
Events</span> mode, the component source is shown with its callback methods
displayed as children. Items in the tree for events are green arrows <img src="../images/e2mconn_obj.gif" alt="green arrows" />, and blue arrows <img src="../images/p2pconn_obj.gif" alt="blue arrow icon" /> if the items are
for property change events.</p>
<p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Expert Events</span> mode,
each listener for the component is shown as a child tree node, and the events
are shown beneath each listener. This increases the number of items in the
tree, but it shows more detail about how the events are attached to the components.
The option of the two modes lets you decide which level of detail you wish
to work with.</p>
<p>In expert mode the icon used for the listener shows the
type of listener class. If the listener is an anonymous inner class that implements
the listener interface, the <img src="../images/eventpresent_anon_obj.gif" alt="event present icon" /> icon is used, and if the listener is an anonymous
inner class that extends a listener adapter class, the <img src="../images/eventpresent_class_obj.gif" alt="event present class" /> icon is used.</p>
<p>In addition to anonymous
inner classes being used for listeners, named classes and shared listeners
are also parsed and recognized by the visual editor. If the listener is not
anonymous in expert mode, then the icon is <img src="../images/genlistener_obj.gif" alt="gen listener icon" /> . If the listener is shared by more than one component,
the <img src="../images/shrdclass_obj.gif" alt="shared class object" /> is
used. If the listener class is used by a single event, then these are
listed as children of the listener. However, if the listener class is used
by more than one event listener interface for the component, then in Expert
mode these listener interfaces are shown as separate children of the listener
class. This is shown below:<br /><img src="../images/ExpertEvents_Shared.gif" alt="expert events shared" /><br /> </p>
<p>The source for this
is shown below.  The inner listener class IvjEventHandler is used once
by the first button (this) for a keyPressedEvent, and twice by the "Cancel"
button, once for keyPressed (that is part of the key event) and another time
for actionPerformed (that is part of the action event).</p>
<div class="p"> <pre>class IvjEventHandler implements java.awt.event.ActionListener, java.awt.event.KeyListener {    public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent e) {      
   if (e.getSource() == VCEStyle2.this.getCancelButton())     
   connEtoC3(e);   
};    
 public void keyPressed(java.awt.event.KeyEvent e) {      
    if (e.getSource() == VCEStyle2.this.getCancelButton())     
    connEtoC2(e);   
if (e.getSource() == VCEStyle2.this)     
    connEtoC1(e);   
};    
 public void keyReleased(java.awt.event.KeyEvent e) {};    
 public void keyTyped(java.awt.event.KeyEvent e) {}; 
}; </pre>
