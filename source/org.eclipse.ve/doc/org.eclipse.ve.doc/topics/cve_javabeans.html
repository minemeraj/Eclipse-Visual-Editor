<h1 class="topictitle1">How it works: the visual editor and Java Beans</h1>
<div><p>A model of live Java beans is maintained by the visual editor,
allowing you to see the graphical representation of Java beans that are java.awt.Component
subclasses, and to display the values in the Properties view for unset properties.</p>
<p>The visual editor does this by creating a target VM for each instance of
the visual editor, where the Java bean classes used by the editor are loaded,
instantiated, and sent the <samp class="codeph">get</samp> and <samp class="codeph">set</samp> methods
as required.</p>
<p>Typically, you do not need to be concerned with this VM. However, situations
may arise where you need to analyze or debug behavior specific to it. For
example, when exceptions are thrown by the Java beans in a target VM, you
might need to debug.</p>
<p>Since the target VM is running live code, there is an overhead associated
with it in terms of performance and fidelity of the application. If you develop
a Java bean that will be executed in the target VM, and you want its behavior
in the visual editor environment to be different in a run-time VM, you can
query the static method <samp class="codeph">java.beans.Beans.isDesignTime()</samp>.
This returns the value <tt class="sysout">true</tt> for the visual editor's
target VM, and <tt class="sysout">false</tt> otherwise.</p>
