<h1 class="topictitle1">About the visual editor for Java</h1>
<div><p>The visual editor for Java is a code-centric Java editor that helps
you design applications that have a graphical user interface (GUI). The visual
editor is based on the JavaBeans component model and supports visual construction
using the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT),
or Swing.</p>
<p>The visual editor is designed to work with .java source files, letting
you edit the source and work on the visual design simultaneously. The visual
editor does not have its own perspective. If you use the visual editor in
the Java perspective, the visual editor for Java uses any customization that
you have made to the position of the Tasks view, the Console view and the
Outline view.</p>
<p>You can use the visual editor for Java to create a visual class using a
wizard, then design the class using visual components, or Java beans, from
a design palette. This class can be an executable application (a class with
a main method) or it can be a Java bean that you intend to include in another
class. To be used as a Java bean by the visual editor for Java there is no
interface that must be implemented and the only requirement is that the editor
knows how to instantiate the class. For most purposes this means that the
class should be public and have a public null constructor. The null constructor
cannot be abstract, and it can be explicit or implicit, although there are
a few exceptions that the visual editor for Java recognizes, for example java.awt.Dialog
subclasses (which are instantiated using the java.awt.Frame argument constructor)
or SWT controls. Certain other classes are recognized and can be dropped or
sub-classed, such as Eclipse RCP views or editors. The visual editor adds
an explicit constructor that calls the initialize method, which is used to
set up the initial state of the Java bean.</p>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/cve_designsource.html">The visual editor Design and Source views</a></strong><br />
The visual editor for Java is divided into two main windows: the Design view and the Source view. The Design view previews the Java beans in a graphical representation, while the Source view shows the associated Java code.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/cve_palette.html">The visual editor palette</a></strong><br />
The visual editor for Java includes a palette of components and other selection tools for you to use in the Design view.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/cve_propertiesview.html">The visual editor Properties view</a></strong><br />
The Properties view shows the properties for the Java bean that is selected in either the Design view or the Java Beans view. You can use the Properties view to change the value of a given property.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/cve_javabeansview.html">The Java Beans view</a></strong><br />
The Java Beans view of the visual editor for Java shows a tree view of the components, events, and listeners used by the Java class that you are composing. You can use this view to work with the components.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/cve_codesync.html">Java code and visual design synchronization in the visual editor</a></strong><br />
By default, the visual editor for Java continuously synchronizes the source code and the Design view. This synchronization can be paused or reloaded manually at any time, and the delay before synchronization occurs can be set as a preference.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/cve_codegen.html">Java code generation and parsing in the visual editor</a></strong><br />
The visual editor generates and parses Java code as you design your visual class. The visual editor uses a particular style for its generated Java code, and it has rules for parsing Java code.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/tve_prefs.html">Setting visual editor preferences</a></strong><br />
You can set preferences that affect the appearance of the visual editor, the way the visual editor generates and parses Java code, and other preferences.</li>
</ul>
