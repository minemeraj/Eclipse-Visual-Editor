<h1 class="topictitle1">Aligning components using X/Y alignment</h1>
<div><p>When you set the layout manager to null, you can use the Customize
Layout window to align components based on their bounds.</p>
<div class="skipspace"><p>With layout set to null, each component is independently placed
and sized on the user interface based on its bounds. To avoid the tedious
and error-prone task of individually updating each component's bounds, you
can use the visual editor to align and adjust the sizes and placement of components
based on relationships.</p>
<div class="p">When layout is set to null, the Customize Layout
window has a number of actions that work on a group of components. You can:<ul><li>Align components based on edges</li>
<li>Align components based on center points</li>
<li>Make components the same width and height</li>
<li>Distribute components evenly, both vertically and horizontally, across
a given space</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, you can select three JButton components and specify
that they should be the same width and aligned with each other on the left
bound. The last selected JButton is used as the anchor, or control, for the
other two buttons. The <span class="uicontrol">Align left</span> action aligns the
JButtons with the left edge of the last selected JButton, and the <span class="uicontrol">Match
width</span> action makes the selected JButtons the same width as the
control JButton.</p>
<p>The alignment buttons on the Customize Layout window
are only enabled if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul><li>Two or more components are selected, and the parent containers have no
layout manager (null).</li>
<li>The components have no parent and have been placed on the Design view
directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to aligning components and matching width and height,
you can distribute components. When components are distributed, their positions
are changed so that they are evenly spaced within a bounding box defined by
their parent container. For example, the <span class="uicontrol">Distribute vertical</span> button
 <img src="../images/distributevert_obj.gif" alt="distribute vertical button" /> will
arrange the following controls so that they have the same spacing:</p>
<p> <img src="../images/Align_01.gif" alt="beans as placed on Design view" /> By
clicking <span class="uicontrol">Distribute vertical</span>, it will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/Align_02.gif" alt="beans distributed vertically" /></p>
<p>Notice
that the three buttons are distributed within the height of the parent (the
frame's top and bottom edge).</p>
<p>To allow for more control over the area
used for the distribution, you can enable the distribute box with the alignment
window button  <img src="../images/distributebox_obj.gif" alt="distribute box" />.
This will show a box drawn around the area of all the selected components,
which can be moved and resized using its handles. When a 'distribute' occurs
and the box is active, the area that is divided up to reposition the controls
will be the distribute box, rather than the parent container.</p>
<p> <br /><img src="../images/Align_03.gif" alt="beans with distribution box" /><br /> The
box can be moved and resized  <br /><img src="../images/Align_04.gif" alt="beans in resized distribution box" /><br /> and vertical distribute is now within this box.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/Align_05.gif" alt="beans distributed vertically within box" /></p>
<p>To align, resize, and distribute components in
null layout:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Design view or Java Beans view, select two or more components
that you want to align or adjust in relation to each other. You can use the
marquee selection tool or hold the Ctrl key to select multiple components. </span> The last component that you select is the control component, or
anchor. The anchor component is indicated by black resize handles, while the
other selected components have white handles.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Do one of the following to open the Customize Layout window: </span><ul><li>Right-click and select <span class="uicontrol">Customize Layout</span> from
the pop-up menu.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Customize Layout</span> <span><img src="../images/aligndialog_obj.gif" alt="show alignment window icon" /></span> toolbar button.</li>
</ul>
 <br /><img src="../images/customizeLayout_null.gif" alt="Customize Layout window for null layout" /><br /></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To align the components with each other, use the following buttons:</span><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Align left</span> - aligns the components with the
left edge of the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align center</span> - aligns the components with the
center of the anchor component along a vertical plane.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align right</span> - aligns the components with the
right edge of the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align top</span> - aligns the components with the
top edge of the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align middle</span> - aligns the components with the
middle of the anchor component along a horizontal plane.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Align bottom</span> - aligns the components with the
bottom edge of the anchor component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To adjust the size of the selected components, use the following
buttons:</span><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Match width</span> - makes the components the same
width as the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Match height</span> - makes the components the same
height as the anchor component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To distribute the spacing of the components, first do one of the
following to specify the bounds of the distribution area:</span><ul><li>Click nothing to use the container as the distribution area (this
is the default behavior), or click <span class="uicontrol">Hide distribute box</span> if
the box is already showing.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Show distribute box</span> and drag the
handles of the box to create the desired size for your distribution.</li>
</ul>
 Then, use one of the following buttons to distribute the components:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Distribute horizontally</span> - makes the components
the same width as the anchor component.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Distribute vertically</span> - makes the components
the same height as the anchor component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
