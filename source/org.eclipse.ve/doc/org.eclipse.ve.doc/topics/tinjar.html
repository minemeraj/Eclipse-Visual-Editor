<h1 class="topictitle1">Keeping BeanInfo classes in a JAR file</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"><p>BeanInfo classes can exist in a separate project from Java beans,
and can be in a JAR file. This situation could occur if you have some Java
beans and their BeanInfo classes in two separate JAR files. To use the Java
beans and browse their source code, they can be imported into a project as
a zip or JAR file. Then the contents of the file can be expanded to their
individual entries. Alternatively, to save space, the BeanInfo classes can
be left in the .jar, and the file is imported as is.</p>
<p>A JAR file represents
a zipped directory structure. For the BeanInfo Path to include any packages
within the .jar in the introspector's search path, the JAR file must first
be included and the package selected. To do this, use the  <b>Add JARs</b> button
in the  <b>BeanInfo classes</b> tab of the BeanInfo Path dialog.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/nbninfo.gif" alt="BeanInfo properties" /> </p>
<p>For example,
MyProject contains the Java bean  <tt class="sysout">runtimeclasses.MyBeanInfo</tt>.
The JAR file designtime.jar contains its BeanInfo in the package  <tt class="sysout">beaninfoclasses</tt>.</p>
<p>The
designtime.jar file should be imported into the project MyProject using the
import wizard from the  <b>File</b> menu. If you specify that you want to
import designtime.jar as a ZIP file or a JAR file, its contents will be expanded
and all you need to do is use the packages tab of the BeanInfo Path to include
the beaninfoclasses package in the introspector's search path. You can also
import designtime.jar as an unexpanded resource in MyProject. Since the designtime.jar
is only used during design, not build, it does not need to be added to the
Java Build path.</p>
<p>Use the  <b>Add JARs</b> button on the BeanInfo classes
tab on the BeanInfo Path dialog. This will bring up a list of all folders
containing JAR files as shown below. On this dialog select the JAR file containing
the BeanInfo classes and press  <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>After specifying that designtime.jar
contains BeanInfo classes, you must add its packages that include the BeanInfo
classes to the search path. Do this by selecting the  <b>Modify Paths</b> button
in the BeanInfo classes tab, making sure the entry for the designtime.jar
is selected. The Modify Paths dialog brings up a list of defined packages
for the selected entry. This is the same dialog shown earlier for BeanInfo
classes that existed in another project. However, when  <b>Choose packages</b> is
chosen, a dialog is opened where you must enter the name of the package.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/nentpkgn.gif" alt="Specifying package name" /> </p>
<p>This
dialog does not allow you to select from a list of available packages in the
JAR file. Instead, you must know the name of the package and enter it before
clicking  <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p><b>jar file containing the BeanInfo classes has
not been imported into a project</b></p>
<p>In addition to importing the JAR
file into the project containing the Java beans, it is possible that the JAR
file exists in the file system and not as part of the IDE. In this situation,
click the <b>Add External JARs</b> button in the <b>BeanInfo classes </b>page.</p>
<p>A
file browser for JAR file selections opens. Having included the JAR file in
the BeanInfo classes list, you must still specify its packages that contain
the BeanInfo classes. Do this by selecting the <b>Modify Paths</b> button
and typing the package name in the dialog, as shown above for the scenario
where the JAR file existed in the project.  </p>
