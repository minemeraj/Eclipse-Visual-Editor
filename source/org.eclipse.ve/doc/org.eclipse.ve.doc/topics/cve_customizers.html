<h1 class="topictitle1">Customizers for Java bean properties</h1>
<div><p>A customizer is an additional dialog that users can launch to change
Java bean properties. You can create customizer classes for editing properties
of Java beans that you add to the visual editor.</p>
<p>A customizer class should implement the interface java.beans.Customizer,
and should also be a subclass of java.awt.Component. Usually, a customizer
is a container such as a java.awt.Panel or javax.swing.JPanel that contains
the controls to let you view and manipulate your Java bean's properties. When
the customizer is launched from the toolbar button, it is hosted inside a
dialog that has <span class="uicontrol">OK</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Cancel</span> buttons.</p>
<p>When a user opens a customizer, the customizer is given the Java bean it
is customizing as part of the method <samp class="codeph">public void setObject(Object
bean);</samp>. The customizer is then able to make changes directly to the
argument.</p>
<p>The java.beans.Customizer interface also has the methods <samp class="codeph">public
void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener);</samp> and <samp class="codeph">public
void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener)</samp>.
The visual editor will add itself as a listener on the customizer, and if
the customizer is to refresh the appearance of the Java bean on the Design
view, it should signal a property change by calling its listeners with any
of the methods <samp class="codeph">firePropertyChange(...</samp> with any set of arguments.</p>
<p>When your user clicks <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>, the visual editor will
try to determine what changes the customizer has made to the Java bean so
it can update the Java source code. To do this, the visual editor takes a
copy of all the Java bean's properties before the customizer is launched,
and then compares them with the properties when the customizer is closed.
If any property is different ( returns false to the equals method), it is
determined to have been changed. To determine the argument to the set method
for the property, the property editor on the java.beans.PropertyDescriptor
is created. Then, it is called with <samp class="codeph">public void setValue(Object)</samp> and <samp class="codeph">public
String getJavaInitializationString();</samp>. Likewise, when you click <span class="uicontrol">Cancel</span>,
because the customizer has already changed the Java bean, the visual editor
queries the set of properties and resets any that are different to their initial
state.</p>
<p>If the customizer is a top level shell that does not require a dialog to
run within, such as a java.awt.Frame or javax.swing.JFrame, the visual editor
will run the customizer as is. Because this type of customizer is responsible
for its own set of buttons and the visual editor has no way of knowing whether
it was canceled or confirmed, whenever the customizer is closed, the top level
properties are queried to see whether they have changed. Thus, if the customizer
performs a cancel it must do so, thereby ensuring the Java bean's properties
are restored to their initial state.</p>
<p>After you write a customizer, it needs to be set on the bean descriptor
for the BeanInfo class for the Java bean:</p>
<pre>public class MyClassBeanInfo extends SimpleBeanInfo {
    public BeanDescriptor getBeanDescriptor() {
        return new BeanDescriptor(MyClass.class,
MyCustomizer.class);
    }
}</pre>
