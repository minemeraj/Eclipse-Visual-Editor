<h1 class="topictitle1">Null layout manager</h1>
<div><p>Rather than using a layout manager that controls the size and position
of all components in a container, you can set the layout manager to  <b>null</b>.
Each component then controls its own position and size using its bounds.</p>
<p>If you right-click a container and set the  <b>Show Grid</b> option, you
can drag, drop, and move components to a point on the grid, giving you the
ability to align components to positions without using the alignment actions:
 <br /><img src="../images/NullShowGrid.gif" alt="Show Grid in null layout" /><br /> 
You can also start with a null layout manager and then change to a layout
(like the GridBagLayout) to get the constraint setting calculated by the Visual
Editor for Java. The advantage of having each component control its size and
position is that you can specify the x,y, width and height and be sure that
these will always be used at runtime. The disadvantage of having fixed size
and height is that the GUI will not change these if it is resized by the user,
or if the labels on components such as buttons or checkboxes change size based
on the user's font or locale.</p>
<p>To see this behavior in the Visual Editor for Java you can use the drop-down
list of values in the Properties view for the layout property and select  <b>null</b>.</p>
<p>When you change the layout manager for an existing container to null, the
Design view does not change in appearance. The reason is that the Visual Editor
for Java calculates the current bounds of each component and explicitly sets
them for you. For example, suppose you have a container that uses the flow
layout manager and contains a JLabel bean. Before you change to the null layout
manager, the code to initialize the JLabel bean has just its label property
set, as shown here:</p>
<pre>private javax.swing.JLabel getIvjJLabel(){
    if(ivjJLabel == null) {
       ivjJLabel = new javax.swing.JLabel();
       ivjJLabel.setText("JLabel");
    }
    return ivjJLabel;
}</pre>
<p>If you then use the Properties view to change the layout manager to null,
the code would look something like this:  </p>
<pre>private javax.swing.JLabel getIvjJLabel(){
    if(ivjJLabel == null) {
       ivjJLabel = new javax.swing.JLabel();
       ivjJLabel.setBounds(59, 10, 38, 15);
       ivjJLabel.setText("JLabel");
    }
    return ivjJLabel;
}</pre>
<p>In the same example, as soon as you set the layout manager to null, the
Properties view for each component displays values for bounds, size, and location.
These values do not appear when the parent container uses any other layout
manager other than null, because component properties do not change when the
layout manager controls positioning and sizing.</p>
<p>When you set the null layout manager for a container, the handles for each
component in the Design view allow resizing. You can also size a bean using
the null layout manager as you add it from the palette. Simply hold down the
left mouse button when you drop the bean in the Design view, and drag the
mouse pointer until the bean is the desired size. A target feedback rectangle
shows you the initial size. In any other layout manager you are only allowed
to move components.</p>
