<h1 class="topictitle1">JSplitPane and its components</h1>
<div><p>The visual editor has special behavior to make it easy to work
with a Swing JSplitPane container.</p>
<p>The class javax.swing.JSplitPane allows you to have two components with
a split bar between them. At runtime, a user can drag the split bar to adjust
the space on the screen. </p>
<p>In the visual editor, the two child components are shown beneath the JSplitPane
on the Java Beans view. When you drop a new component onto a JSplitPane in
the Java Beans view or the Design view, the visual editor will try to place
the component in the left pane if there is no existing child. If there is
already a component in the left pane, the component that you are dropping
will be added to the right pane. If both panes in the JSplitPane are already
occupied, the visual editor will not allow you to drop the component.</p>
<p>Whether the visual editor for Java shows the left and right component as
children depends on the value of its orientation property. If this property
is set to VERTICAL_SPLIT then the bottom and top component are shown instead.</p>
<p>The method generated for each of the split pane children is to set one
of its properties using a <samp class="codeph">set</samp> method. For example:</p>
<pre>ivjJSplitPane.setTopComponent(getIvjJButton());</pre>
<p>In addition to setting a component using a set method, it can be added
using a constraint of "top", "bottom" "left" or "right". For example:  </p>
<pre>ivjJSplitPane.addComponent(getIvjJButton(),"top");</pre>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Although the visual editor generates code that uses the <samp class="codeph">set</samp> method,
the Design view will also recognize the <tt class="sysout">add(Component,Object)</tt> method
with a valid constraint.</div>
<p>When you drop components onto a JSplitPane, if the divider location is
not explicitly set, the divider location will change according to the preferred
size of the left or top component. Then it will fill the opposite side with
the remaining component if one is set. For example, if you drop a JPanel into
a JSplitPane with no components, it will be assigned by default to the left
side. The divider location will move to the far left in the split pane because
the preferredSize for a JPanel is very small. If you then drop components
onto the JPanel, which is using a FlowLayout, the split pane will resize according
to the preferred size of the JPanel, which has now changed because of the
preferred sizes of the components that were added to it.</p>
<p>The visual editor will render JLayeredPane indexes in a single layer. In
the case of multilayer and indexes, the visual editor may not show the components
in the correct order.</p>
