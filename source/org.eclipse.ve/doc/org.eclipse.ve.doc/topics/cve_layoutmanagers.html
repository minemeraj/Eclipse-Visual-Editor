<h1 class="topictitle1">Layout managers and containers</h1>
<div><p>Layout managers are objects that control the size and position
of components within a container.</p>
<p>Some Java beans allow relationships between themselves. For example, the
class java.awt.Container allows instances of java.awt.Component to be added
to it as part of its components relationship. An example of java.awt.Container
is a panel or a frame. An example of java.awt.Component is a button or a text
box. In the visual editor for Java, containment relationships are shown in
the Java Beans view and in the Design view.</p>
<p>A layout manager is an object that controls the size and position of components
within a container. You can set the layout manager on a container to null
and allow each component to size and position itself. However, the position
of the GUI components will not correspond to the changes you make when you
resize the window. Rather than having a fixed size and position for each component,
the container will delegate the sizing and positioning of its components by
using a layout manager.</p>
<p>Each layout manager has its own rules for distributing the components,
but most layout managers place each component so that it is at least as big
as its preferred size. The preferred size of components with user visible
strings, such as button or label, is calculated dynamically. So, as the string
length changes due to different locales or fonts, the layout manager will
reposition each component. As the window is resized by a user at runtime,
the layout manager also repositions each component to optimize the new overall
size. This makes layout managers invaluable for building user interfaces that
will be deployed in an environment where label strings, fonts, or window size
may vary.</p>
<p>Swing and Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT) containers use the same set of
layout managers, which are mostly AWT objects. Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)
containers use their own SWT layout managers.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If you use a layout manager not supplied in the Visual Editor, the Design
view will still construct the container correctly and render the components.
However, you won't be able to update constraints using the Properties view
or Design view.</div>
